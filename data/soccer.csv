6,Can someone explain to me how to U23 system works in England?,"I just watched YouTube highlight video from Everton U23 vs Fullham U23. It seemed worlds different from premier league football.  

The pitch was in horrible shape.  Patchy and bumpy, my high school pitch was in better shape than what they were playing on. 

There were no fans, so I'm assuming they don't sell tickets.  

They were playing in a super tiny ""stadium"" with stands.  But they had an announcer, which was kinda cool.  

So basically, my questions are, how much do the youths get paid?  $1,000/week? More? Less? Why don't they sell tickets? It could bring in extra income even in minuscule amounts, and I know I would love to go to a U23 game for $3-$5.  It'd be fun.  Also, how likely are the players to stay with their current clubs if they make it to the top tier leagues?  Do most players make it? Or is it more of just a way to get players closer and scout them?  Do you *have* to be under 23 to play, or is it just basically fifth string first team players?  What would the average age be?  15? 18? 20?  


I live in America and we have nothing even remotely similar to the amount of structured football Europe has to offer, so I know nothing about it but I find it really interesting.",soccer,1579370480,coco4shade,33,1,True,2020-01-18

66,Why Valverde is not as bad as people portray.,"Valverde is often criticised for pragmatic style and the two back to back defeats. But he certainly brought good things to the club as well. Offlate, the hate on Valverde by Cules is pretty high, hence decided to tell them why he wasn't our worst, actually one of the better managers we had in our 100+ year history.

* Our **board brought Valverde knowing very well of his pragmatic style.** Our defence was in **shambles** in Luis Enrique's final season, with **Real Madrid winning both the league and Champions league.** 
* Valverde was brought to fix that. Not to forget, **Pique** even publicly stated that he felt **""inferior to Madrid for the first time""**
* He **destroyed Real Madrid 5–1 without Lionel Messi and Neymar** at the Santiago Bernabeu.
* He managed to go **43 matches unbeaten in the league** in his first season.
* He managed to win **back to back league titles** despite the hole left by Neymar and Iniesta in subsequent seasons.
* Even though **Andre Gomes** was broken, he worked really hard on trying to integrate him into the team.
* Unlike previous managers, Valverde had to deal with an **ageing squad** that had literally won everything.
* There is not a single player that has complained or fought except for Vidal the last few days. **Unlike Enrique, who had a terrible relationship with the players in his final year.**

And to all of them comparing him to Pep Guardiola, that pool was once in a generation pool. It won't happen. And they were young and hungry, thus a higher drive. All our players have established themselves. They certainly lack the drive more than anything.

To others who say he won the league because of Messi, **didn't Pep win because of Messi? Didn't Enrique win because of Messi?**

Not to forget, **Isn't Messi a part of Valverde's team?**

I could find more, but he really did his best with what he had.

With **Pique partying, Umtiti injured, Iniesta retired, Neymar missing, Ousmane broken, Coutinho no confidence, Alba crying, Busquets relaxing,** he did everything he can.

He certainly doesn’t deserve the criticism.

Most people need to understand that we lost terribly the previous seasons too. **Bayern 7–0, PSG 4–0, Juventus 3–0, Athletico Madrid ( two times) and more.** Winning and Losing is part of the game.

Let's thank him for what he has done, and wish him the best, even though our board treated him like shit.",soccer,1579376439,NextCrab2,6,1,True,2020-01-18

122,[Discussion] What are your silly reasons for hating certain clubs?,"Not an hour goes by on this sub without some post containing stats of some sorts. And lord knows there are more self-proclaimed experts here than anywhere on Reddit. But even with all the knowledge shared football is first and foremost a game which thrives on feelings. 

And feelings often aren't rational. So I considered the loooong list of clubs I personally dislike for more or less random reasons. I follow two clubs intensely: AFC Ajax and Manchester United. The former I started following because I saw them play I game (I'll get back to that one). The latter I became a fan of because their goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, was Danish like me.

So naturally I dislike clubs like Liverpool, Leeds, City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool (I hate them that much), Feyenoord, PSV, ADO Den Haag etc. Nothing especially irrational about that.

But I also dislike a bunch of clubs for more or silly reasons, and I got to wonder:

* **Which obscure clubs do you hate or dislike and why?**
* **How much energy do you spend on said clubs?**

To start with the latter I check the results of all clubs I dislike every week. And if they muck it up, I'll probably find highlights online. If they really did themselves I might even lurk in the fan fora just to revel in their misery. I don't take part in the discussions, cause I try not to be a prick, but I do absolutely *love* their misery.

My list of disliked clubs is as long as it is irrational. But the most notable mentions, ranked by a mixture of my dislike and the arbitrary reasons of me disliking said club, are:

**AC Milan**: The first two clubs I ever followed were AFC Ajax, who I stuck by, and PSG, who I didn't. Back in 94/95 Milan beat PSG in the CHL. I was devastated, even more so when Milan snatched up my favorite player at the time, George Weah. 

Milan were then beaten in the final by Ajax, but not long after that the Bosman ruling made it possible for players to transfer for no fee if they had 6 months or less left on their contract. This ruling absolutely fucked over Ajax, and a lot of the players went to Milan, leaving Ajax in a crippled state which lasted decades. I've absolutely hated AC Milan ever since, also fueled by their ties with Berlusconi.

**Juventus:** Fast forward 12 months after Ajax' victory over AC Milan. Some players were starting to leave, but the club was still doing well. They reached the final the year after and lost very undeservedly against Juventus on penalties. Since then it was revealed that a lot of the Juve players were [probably using doping](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/ajax-juventus-1996-champions-league-final-doping-cheating-calciopoli-a8860746.html), but really for me it wasn't about that. I was just an extremely sore loser at 12 years old, and I never got over that one. I've hated the old hag ever since.

**Bayern Munich:** Another lifetime of dislike starting within a very short time span in a very young and dumb mind. The first game I vividly remember watching from start to finish was Ajax-Bayern Munich in the semi-finals of 94/95. Ajax won the game 5-2 and it really was a fantastic game. But what I remember most clearly is watching it with my grandma, a young woman during WW2 who had ever since had a love-hate relationship with Germans. 

She loved a lot about Germany, its amazing culture and the people but she also had a grudge, which she never really got over. And much of that grudge seemed to be channeled specifically at Bayern and especially Jürgen Klinsmann ""*that arrogant bastard, ugh!*"" Hey, who was I to disagree with my knowledgeable grandma, so that day I began following Ajax and thoroughly dislike FC Bayern. Because of *Klinsi.*

**Real Madrid:** Figo. I simply felt bad for the useless FC Barcelona who at that time fucked up at a rate that made it seem like it was scheduled. When I later learned about Franco's involvement in Real Madrid one radicalized anti-Madridista was born. It didn't make me like Blaugrana, just hate Real Madrid and root for anyone other than them.

**Porto:** Now, this one is as stupid as they get. I watched Eurogoals every monday growing up. A show that provided the goals from most of the European leagues, including Portugal. And for some reason I just really *hated* whenever those guys in blue and white scored, even though they had Jardel, a guy who I absolutely loved for his ability to do just that. They ALWAYS seemed to win and how I hated it. So I started to grow a grudge against them, and that grudge was cemented when a smug Jose Mourinho gloated after beating United in the 2003/04 Champions League. 

**Lyon** (and **Dinamo Zagreb**): Well this one maybe isn't so irrational after all. I mean, [come on](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2071803/Ajax-want-probe-Lyons-7-1-win-Dinamo-Zagreb.html).

**Rosenborg:** Being a petty Dane I really didn't like their success in the CHL around the turn of the century. ""*Everybody loves the Norwegian underdogs who continue to impress against the biggest teams*."" Oh, sod off!

**Shakhtar Donetsk**: [Bloody cheats](https://youtu.be/NuC9R7omjJ4?t=22).

That's it, the ball's rolling. Hopefully a few of you read through it all and hopefully we'll get a fun discussion going. If we do, I hope we can keep it light. 

After all, my intention wasn't to start a shitshow but rather a fun discussion about the silly reasons that can ignite a lifetime of passioned contempt.",soccer,1579384249,AlexanderSupertrampr,280,1,True,2020-01-18

Aguero is a one-trick pony who is a good kicker and that’s it. He is not a complete footballer by any means. He camps by the goal does a fake and takes potshots. He can’t dribble, he can’t pass, he can’t press he cant tackle. All he does is exploit the fact he is the size of a toddler. You know that jerk who keeps spinning the foosball arm whenever he plays?

176,[SERIOUS] The inconsistency of PL-referees this season,"I've been watching PL and Arsenal on the regular since I was very young, and we all know that hating on the officials is basically a fundamental part of the game. The referees are human and the human factor of making the wrong decision will always be there, and there's not much we can do about it but hope that the referees are stiving for 100%.   


Now this is where the problem comes in. This season has been disasterous so far, and I'm talking the general quality of every single game up 'til this round. I know there's big changes going on in PL with VAR and all, and obviously there's still some kinks to straighten out with the system, but how can that affect the overall refereeing this badly?   


There are teams losing matches and possibilities to fairly compete in the bigger european tournaments and the money involved with this fact. Not to even mention the individual players getting serious injuries that in the worst case might stall or disturb the opportunities to develop their career (example: Torreira being targeted every single game).   


I may be partial here, but after watching Arsenals latest games, there's been shockingly uneven decisions and quite unacceptable ones too. The officals in the PL have never been perfect, but  this season has seriously taken a SERIOUS dip, and although everyone are talking about this on the internet, nothing seem to be happening, like... in reality.

285,[OC] [LONG] Bayern Munich - Looking for Patterns in Failures,"### Introduction

The sacking of Niko Kovac on November, by Bayern Munich, reminded me of the similar drama happened a few years back. Sacking of the Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti, [1](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/28/pep-guardiola-carlo-ancelotti-bayern) in his second season at Bayern Munich. Then our beloved Jupp Heynckes took over and revived the squad and we had a good season. Carlo Ancelotti was sacked purely because he didn't know German is what I feel. That caused dressing room issues (/s). In other words, some senior players went against him and the board stood with players. The Result was Ancelotti getting sacked by Bayern Munich just in the beginning of second season. Before all that drama Ancelotti brought his favourite, one of my favourite midfielder, James Rodriguez, to the club. A wonderful, wonderful player, who is great at creating chances and he sometimes scores too. 

The German giants are undergoing a complete transformation at every level. New team, new board, new management and Mr Bayern, **Uli Hoeness,**  has stepped down from the position as president of the club. [2](https://m.dw.com/en/uli-hoeness-from-young-visionary-to-old-school-patriarch/a-51215403) He has been with Bayern for 49 years, and played a key role in creating what FC Bayern Munich is today.  An old school patriarch, even though there are controversies in the end periods of his career, his contributions in developing the club are nothing less than remarkable.

**In this piece I look at the issues in FC Bayern Munich, through all the transfer dramas and why Ancelotti and Kovac failed to establish a regime change in the club. I will also talk about the power struggle within the Bayern and of course about Mr. Bayern. Instead of achievements let's walk through the failure.**

You are the manager of the Free Peoples' team and you need to field a team consisting of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring (Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf (the Grey), Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn and Boromir) and 2 additional characters from the films/books. The only restriction is that the additional players have to be from the free peoples' side (so no Sauron or Witch-King) and they need to be humanoid (so no Gwaihir the eagle on the right wing).

345,[OC] Messi's worth in football shoes and some perspective to it,"Hello /r/soccer, what's up?

&amp;#x200B;

In a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/equ3vh/when_racing_santander_signed_quique_seti%C3%A9n_from/) about how the current Barça trainer Quique Setién was transferred in 1977 for 40 pairs of shoes, /u/stonewalled89 asked what Messi's worth in shoes would be. I calculated Messi's worth in his Adidas Nemeziz shoe, which I saw him wearing in a more or less current video. The shoe is listed for £299.95 on the [adidas uk store](https://www.adidas.co.uk/nemeziz-19_-firm-ground-boots/EF8280.html) and Messi's market value is £126'000'000, according to transfermarket. This gives us 547'945 complete pairs of his shoe. To put that into some perspective, I wanted to see how many shoes the players in each of the [Uefa-Top-10-Countries](https://de.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2020) could receive. I took all of the leagues I could find on transfermarket, but did not go below the 5. league. In some cases, several leagues make up one division (like in Italy, Serie C, which consists of 3 different leagues). I simply added these leagues together.

**Post match Summary**

&gt; Emphatic. Chelsea are fighting for this title - they have ended Arsenal’s eight-match winning streak in the WSL and have done the double over the Gunners following that win previous back in October. They won the match with a stunning three-goal barrage inside the first 20 minutes. Blues manager Emma Hayes said before the match that their attacking play was constantly improving, and she was proved absolutely right. Beth England’s superbly-taken first goal set the tone, Sam Kerr’s smart header made it two (her first goal for the club), before Sophie Ingle’s sensational half-volley flew into the top corner in that early blitz.
&gt; 
&gt;Man City are now top of the WSL on goal difference with +28, to Arsenal’s +27, both teams on 33 points. On top of the fact they got battered today, that’s a psychological blow for Arsenal to drop off the top of the table. It will be a test for them to pick themselves up, but with the quality in their squad, there is no question they can do just that. Chelsea are a point further back - but with a game in hand. Of course they have also vastly improved their goal difference, and are now on +26.

446,"Tipsextra; The reason why Swedish attendances halved and why hundreds of Scandinavians still travel to England to see Aston Villa, Ipswich and Luton","Back in 1967, Lars Gunnar Björklund, CEO of the Swedish Public Service, traveled to the UK and saw Tottenham face Chelsea. It was then and there he thought of the possibilities to bring the English game to the homes of Sweden. Together with his colleagues from Denmark and Norway, they eventually made a deal with British ITV for the broadcasting rights, worth 850$/match. People were worried that it would lure people away from the Swedish terraces and hurt the domestic clubs. The decision was therefore made to only show matches between November and March, during the Swedish off season.

With everything set and ready, Tipsextra was aired for the first time in the winter of 1969 (a good 14 years before the UK started to show matches regularly!). 22 players from Wolverhampton and Sunderland ran on to a freezing Molineux and started what would become a footballing revolution in Sweden.

Tipsextra became a massive success right from the start and was soon a vital part of the Swedish family homes. Every Saturday at 4 o clock, thousands upon thousands of people would be sat in front of the TV, drinking beer and watching match of the week. A growing fascination for the English clubs grew for every week. They were drawn in by the quality of play and the atmosphere in the stands and it didn't take long before people had found themselves their favorite team. Nor did it take long for people to start longing for the idea of experiencing it in person.

Most people were drawn to the success of Liverpool, but every single English side that were a regular in the first division in the 70's and 80's gained a huge following in Scandinavia. Clubs like Coventry, Blackburn, Ipswich, Aston Villa all gained plenty of fans. Hundreds of fans of all different teams would now annually go over the pond to see the club in their heart play. 

Whilst the interest in English football only continued to grow, the worries about Swedish attendances dropping proved to be right. Allsvenskan had a steady average attendance of around 10,000 every season prior to the 70's. Starting in 1972, Allsvenskan saw a steady decline in attendances and during the late 70's to the 90's the average dropped below 5,000. In 1997, 28 years after the English first division was shown, Canal+ started to regularly show matches in Allsvenskan and that was also part of the reason to why the league made a recovery. 

Today, Allsvenskan is again a thriving league with good supporter culture. But the massive obsession for English football still lives on, especially with the older generation that grew up with Tipsextra. Even the teams that have have fallen from grace since the 70's and 80's still hold a very special place in thousands of Scandinavian hearts. To this day, you still have supporter groups for Norwich, Fulham, Ipswich and so on. You still see people flying to England for the sole purpose of watching Luton, or Notts County play a match. That is a passion that never will die

All that happened because Public Service decided to televise one single match a week for 50% of the season... That's impressive!",soccer,1579454368,ilovebarca97,88,1,True,2020-01-19

I then realized also playing in the United/Liverpool match is Luke Shaw who has had bad luck with injuries.

Off the top of my head these players are “injury prone” and came from the Southampton academy:

Gareth Bale (Real Madrid)
Theo Walcott (Everton)
Callum Chambers (Arsenal)
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool)
Adam Lallana (Liverpool)
Luke Shaw (Manchester)

Did I miss any? This is probably a result from these players playing from a young age and a coincidence that they come from Southampton as there are many other players like Wilshere, Carroll, etc. Hopefully sports science/player management will prevent repeating career injuries nowadays.

53,Analysis of Class Movement within Premier League - Shrinking Midtable and Solidifying Top Teams,"There is a lot of discussion in the Premier League about the Big Six and the death of midtable clubs. I decided to look into this to determine how much of this is real and how much is just perception.

&amp;nbsp;

To do this, I needed to devise a system for classifying teams as Top Class, Middle Class, and The Rest. After some tinkering, here are the rules I have come up with:

&amp;nbsp;

Top Class: 60 points earned in 2 of last 3 seasons, and none of previous 2 seasons below 50 points.
Middle Class: 50 points earned in 2 of last 3 seasons, and none of previous 2 seasons below 40 points.
The Rest: Everyone else

&amp;nbsp;

I decided on these for the neatness of 40, 50, and 60 points, as well as what they clearly mean. 50 points is generally right about 10th place, and is never in danger of relegation, but also will not contend for Champions League places. Below 40 points in a season is a relegation battle, and midtable sides should not be recently in relegation battles. 60 points means you are winning a lot of matches, and generally puts you in contention for European competition.

&amp;nbsp;

This is how the classes have looked heading into each Premier League season by these definitions.

&amp;nbsp;

**92-93** | 
Top Class | Middle Class
Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Leeds | Everton, Aston Villa, Wimbledon, Nottingham Forest, Man U, Crystal Palace, Sheffield Wednesday

It is clear, then, that the middle class has been vanishing, and that the top class has solidified, with all of the Big Six in the Top Class every season since 13-14. This season, it is just Everton in the Middle Class, although Burnley, Wolves, Leicester, West Ham, and Watford can all secure Middle Class status for next season by earning 50 points. Leicester and Wolves seem likely to do it. 

&amp;nbsp;

A few fun facts:

Only twice has a team from outside the Top Class won the league: Manchester United from the Middle Class in 92-93 and Leicester from The Rest in 15-16.

No Top Class team has ever been relegated, and Middle Class teams have been relegated 10 times, but not since Portsmouth in 09-10.

12 teams have ever made it into the Top Class in the Premier League, Blackburn and Leeds are the clubs no longer in the Premier League. 

27 teams have ever made it into the Middle Class, Aston Villa leads the way with 12 seasons, while Spurs and Everton have spent 11 seasons each in the Middle Class.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this is an entertaining read. Let me know if you have any questions. Also this was all done by hand so there may be a few errors!",soccer,1578512755,HeLives22,13,1,True,2020-01-08

187,My Lisfranc Injury - cannot kick the ball hard with my right foot anymore,"I injured my right foot due to repetitive stress over an unknown span of time, the kind of pain that I regularly felt was that you experience when you kick the ball with the distal part of the foot,  but although I had felt that pain before and it had gone away many times, there came the day when that pain did not go; after seeing different doctors and receiving therapy that did not solve the problem, one orthopedist diagnosed a stress fracture and told me to wear a cast for 3 months, so I followed his instructions and after those 3 months, the scans revealed the fracture had consolidated. a couple of days later I tried to kick the ball and it felt fine the first few times, but then I kicked it harder and felt the pain again, and it stayed there for months until I saw another specialist, who concluded I had a Lisfranc injury, the fracture had not sealed appropriately so the only fix would be surgery; thing is the surgery is expensive and I'm not sure fixing the joint in question with a screw will not cause further issues when I'm older (I'm 36). Even though I'm not a pro, soccer/football is an important part of my life, and the only activity that gives me a true relief and makes my soul feel free for at least a while; has anyone here experienced something similar? Is it possible to get accustomed to playing with the other foot or found an alternative treatment that allows me to play without undergoing surgery? Any feedback/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

PS: I can kick with the inside and outside of the foot, but as soon as I kick it hard with the laces the pain can leave me limping.",soccer,1578540343,Anibalin7,1,1,True,2020-01-08

I have never seen anything like this since these reports are rarely made public. If you were to do a similar report on the team you support (assuming you watch the games of your team more closely than the opposition) what would that report look like?

I understand this will probably vary between manufacturer but it seems strange that this cannot be easily found or is published for each leagues system. Does the speed of the players factor in due to the frame rate of the cameras used? I'm struggling to find any concrete data about this.

280,/u/madjugah's top 5 most marketable Hungarian League players: January 2020,"I decided to put together a list of players from the Hungarian League who are most likely to be successful abroad. This list is certainly not exhaustive, and depending on the success of this one, I may write another post later on during the year. Feel free ask questions!

&amp;nbsp;

**Dávid Sigér - 29 – Ferencvárosi TC – Central Midfielder**

A late bloomer, he spent most of his career in the lower leagues of Hungary. Two years ago he captained Balmazújváros’ inaugural campaign in the top flight, only to get relegated on the final day. He was a stand-out performer in an otherwise abysmal side, and was signed by Ferencváros in the summer of 2018. Just like so many other talented Hungarian players at the club, many expected him to become a squad-rotation player. On the contrary, Sigér fought himself into the starting XI, ahead of stars who were signed from abroad to take Ferencváros to the next level. 

A deep-lying central midfielder, he was crucial in keeping the scores of opposition teams low in the Europe. Sigér dictates play in the centre of the field, pulling the strings as Ferencváros attempt to build their attacks.  His performances this season - both domestically and the Europa League – have earned him a call up to the Hungarian national team, where he debuted at the age of 28. 

Even though Sigér is now 29, moving to a more competitive league could not only benefit his career, but also enhance a team that lacks stability in the middle of the park. Given his style of play, his age would not hinder his ability to improve in the next few years. Sigér would be most effective in slower-paced and tactics-oriented leagues. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Dénes Dibusz – 29  – Ferencvárosi TC - Goalkeeper**

Arguably the best and most consistent goalkeeper in the league over the past decade, Dénes Dibusz has matured into one of the leaders at Ferencváros. The shot-stopper joined the Hungarian Champions in 2014 and has been their first-choice ever since his debut that year. At the age of 29, this year may be his best opportunity to go abroad. Indeed, it may be the only option to develop his career further.

This year Dibusz was one of the best players during Ferencváros’ European Campaign, having started in all their games. According to UEFA’s official performance database, he was ranked the 9th best keeper in the Europa League group stages, ahead of household names such as Bernd Leno and Rui Patricio. 

Over the years Dibusz has consolidated himself as Hungary’s second choice keeper, only beaten to the Starting XI by RB Leipzig’s vice-captain Péter Gulácsi. Nonetheless, he is ahead of Balázs Megyeri and Ádám Bogdán in the pecking order, both of whom play in arguably more competitive leagues. 

Having won all domestic honours and played in the Europa League with Ferencváros, he has achieved everything on offer in Hungary. It is time for him to find new challenges elsewhere. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Tokmac Nguen – 26 – Ferencvárosi TC - Winger**

Arriving at the club this time last year from Strømsgodset, Tokmac Nguen made an instant impact at Ferencváros. The left-winger scored 4 goals in 12 games last season and was instrumental in securing the club’s 30th title. He continued to be in the form of his life in the first half of the 2019/2020 season, scoring 9 goals and assisting 5 in 28 games.  Not a player to shy away from big fixtures, he was involved in a large proportion of Ferencváros’ goals during their European campaign. 

His exceptional performances are reflected in his market price; in the space of 12 months his Transfermarkt valuation has nearly doubled from €800,000 to €1.5 million. 
Primarily a winger, he has also been deployed as an attacking midfielder and a forward at various points during matches. His slick and accurate finishing, combined with his acceleration, has made him deadly in front of goal, especially during counter-attacks. 

Tokmac’s impressive performances in Europe suggest that the Norwegian has something to offer in a more competitive league, especially when considering he is still only 26. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Loïc Négo - 28 – Fehérvár – Full-back/Winger**

At Fehérvár (club known as Vidi last since) since 2015, he may be best known for scoring a volley against Chelsea in last season’s Europa League. Originally deployed as a winger, he has primarily been used as a right-back or a wing-back over the past few years.
Having the qualities of both a full back and winger has given Nego the ability to utilise both in matches. In addition to being disciplined defensively, he uses his speed to run past opposition players and initiate deadly counter-attacks, which proved to be effective in the Europa League when facing stronger oppositions. 

Nego is also a great crosser of the ball; last season he registered 12 assists in all competitions, including 3 in Europe. Being a former winger, he has retained some essential traits from this position. In addition to being a goal-scoring threat, he is often in space to receive the ball during attacking moves. 

Just like Dibusz, at the age of 28 Nego has won and achieved everything possible in the Hungarian League. This January or at the end of this season would be the perfect time for the Frenchman to part ways with Fehérvár and test himself in a more competitive league. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Obinna Nwobodo – 23 – Újpest - Winger**

When Obinna Nwobodo arrived at Újpest from Nigeria’s Enugu Rangers in 2017, fans had no idea what to expect. However, proving to be a vital addition to the team, he quickly established himself in the starting XI. 

Primarily a winger, Nwobodo has been deployed all over the pitch by manager Nebojša Vignjević over since his arrival, including defensive midfielder and outright striker. He is by far the most creative and technical player in an otherwise average Újpest side. Using his bag of tricks and skills, he glides past players and cuts inside to find a team mate or finish the move himself by having a shot at goal. One of his stand-out performances was against Sevilla in the Europa League qualifiers last season, where he was very dangerous on counter attacks and regularly outran and passed opposition players.

Year-on-year, Nwobodo has improved his goals and assists statistics from the previous season. Many Újpest fans were expecting him to leave at the end of last season to a better league, however, Újpest have managed to keep hold of him for the time being. Knowing owner Roderick Duchâtelet and his willingness to make a quick sale, clubs may be able to buy him at a price close to his €500,000 Transfermarkt valuation.",soccer,1578572504,Madjugah,21,1,True,2020-01-09

377,Debunking the Ashley Young bird shit myth,"So there’s a famous video of a bird shitting in Ashley Young’s mouth that I’m sure most of you have seen. 


https://youtu.be/LoZXEbo96Lg


However he claims that it never happened, and there’s evidence to suggest he’s right. Go the last replay of the video and put it on 0.25x speed. You can clearly see that the bird shit went past his mouth, and then, moments later he moves a piece of chewing gum to the front of his mouth. This sequence of events happens so fast that it creates the illusion that he got shit in his mouth when watching in real time. 

However it’s just an illusion created by the camera angle, chewing gum positioning and velocity of the bird shit. This also helps explains why he has no reaction at all to what’s happened and continues on like normal.

I wear the Adidas ace 17.1 (White/black/yellow colorway) right now. I got them because my previous boots got stolen.

I'm terribly vain when it comes to my boots. But if I look good, I feel good, and when I feel good...I play good. But soccer boots are expensive, so I always wear them to death until I need a new pair. 

Since I got them, they've brought me a lot of good luck. I've played pickup soccer for 4 consecutive weeks since 6 months. And I've scored 8 goals and 4 assists in 4 games. So not bad.

I even nicknamed my boots ""Sonic and Tails"" (Dominant right Foot is Sonic) and (weak but supportive is my left foot)""

434,who are your top 10 best teams of the decade? 2010-2019,"These are mine:

1) 2010/2011 Barcelona - Greatest team of all time for me. Complete domination that year with the exception of Copa Del Rey Final.

2) 2014/2015 Barcelona - To me, 2012/2013 Bayern and 2014/2015 barcelona are extremely close, but i'm giving it to Barcelona because of their greatest front 3 of all time

3) 2012/2013 Bayern - Destroyed a 100 point barcelona team

4) 2016/2017 Real Madrid - Defeated a strong Bayern, best Juventus team of the decade that dominated Barcelona, and strong athletico team

5) 2011/2012 Real Madrid - Had they won the champions league this year, i would have put them #2 on the list. I think this is the best counter attacking team of all time, a yang to 2011/2012 barcelona who are the greatest possession team of all time.

6) 2013/2014 Real Madrid - Destroyed a strong Bayern Munich that was only one year removed from their 2012/2013 squad and beat a strong athletic madrid squad

7) 2018/2019 Liverpool - I would push them above 2013-2014 real madrid had they won the league last year. I think based on talent and performance, 2013/2014 Real Madrid are better than this liverpool team.

8) 2013/2014 Athletic Madrid - Won the league over Barcelona and Real Madrid and almost defeated real madrid in the final. Probably best defensive team of the decade to me... they itch above the 2016-2017 juventus team. Probably move up to #5 or 6 had they beat real madrid in the final.

9) 2016/2017 Juventus - I'd say this team and 2013/2014 athletic madrid team were the best defensive teams. I think the 2013/2014 atheltic madrid team was better... Real Madrid seem to be a nightmare for these teams.

 10) 2017/2018 Manchester City - Great team. won 100 points but they lost pretty badly to a liverpool team that was a worse version of the 2018/2019 liverpool team.",soccer,1578598274,tuf80631,0,1,True,2020-01-09

62,Petition to change offside rule now that VAR is active in the Premier League,"Folks, we started a petition to change the offside rule in light of all the recent overuled goals (think Wolves vs Liverpool) that don’t make much sense and really harm the entertainment value of this great sport.

Here’s the jist: 
The objective of this petition is to change the offside rule in this new era of VAR. As it stands, a play is offside if the player(s) has any body part that is offside. It could be just an inch and virtually have no impact. Instead, we suggest that if the same player(s) has any body part that is ONSIDE, then the play should NOT be called offside.

Here’s the link to the petition: https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/changing-offside-rules-in-var-generation.html

(Apologies for the couple typos - had a wifi prob that didn’t allow me to proof read before it went active)

Here’s more context and logic behind the petition:

It’s become frankly obvious that many offside rulings post VAR review are hurting the game rather helping it. 

The overuling of the Wolves equalizer vs Liverpool (29/12/2019) is yet again an illustration of this fact. VAR showed barely an inch (or less?) of the player as offside, early in the play, and ruled the goal offside. There have already been many identical instances of this issue this season.

Let’s not forget that football is - perhaps above all - a source of entertainment, enjoyed by so many of us. The implementation of VAR has undeniably been a tremendous improvement for football, and perhaps has yet to reach its full potential. It is understandable, however, that VAR would have unplanned consequences, as it is still an innovation to this sport. This issue of overuled offside goals by tiny margins that are only detectable by VAR is arguably one of those issues, and very much harms the entertainment value that is so important to football.

The objective of this petition is therefore to change the offside rule in this new era of VAR. As it stands, a play is offside if the player(s) has any body part that is offside. It could be just an inch and virtually have no impact. Instead, we suggest that if the same player(s) has any body part that is ONSIDE, then the play should NOT be called offside.

We argue this solution provides the kind of tolerance margin that would restore a sense of logic and appreciation for VAR. Furthermore, it would provide more of a safeguard to the entertainment value of football, which is all we care about in the end.",soccer,1577645662,GothamByNight,4,1,True,2019-12-29

However, there are certain situations where the issues caused by VAR are actually due to the VAR exposing weakness in the rules.

For example : an offside is when any part of the players body except the arms is ahead of the last man. 

Before VAR, the human eye would never see these slight things, so it was never obvious how tedious employing that rule can be.

173,"People Of This Subreddit, Who Do You Support, Why, And Have You Got Any Anecdotes?","So, for me:

I’m a Maidenhead United fan. I have been for four years now (I’m 15M), and me and my father are season ticket holders.

We started supporting them just because they happened to be there, and we were bored one Saturday, so we took ourselves down, and got hooked.

I remember, around 2 months after we started supporting them, we got Port Vale in the FA Cup 1st round. We drew away, and went in front after about 25 minutes. We were at home, in front against a side who (at the time) were 3 leagues above us, and we were in front of the cameras for the first time in our history. Sadly, we lost 3-1. But that moment, that nugget of joy and belief and hope is something I’ll never forget. We got a similar nugget this year. Played Rotherham, went 1-0 before going 3-1 down. That moment of jubilation is something that is indescribable.

During the 2016-17 season, we far exceeded expectations and got promoted to the National League, the highest level we’ve ever played at. I’ll never forget the last few games. The penultimate game of the season was against 2nd, and we lost it. Basically, if we did better or equalled them on the last day of the season, we would win the title. Else, they’d win it. But then, the news broke that they were winning. In the end though, it didn’t matter, as we won 3-0 and won the league. There was a party atmosphere, a pitch invasion, the lot. Me and my cut-out trophy are just about visible in the highlights reel from the match if you know where to look.

We don’t talk about our away day to Coventry’s (ex?) ground, the Ricoh arena. Soulless. Empty. Basically no food. Terrible

We also don’t talk about that time we travelled (checks google) 300 miles/5 hours to Gateshead... just to lose 7-1. Very long journey home.

I’m not (sort of) in exile in Somerset, but I still regularly go to games. There’s a great community; I once met a striker down the park and he inflated my football for me.

176,[OC] 6 months of craziness in Liga MX will culminate tonight in the Final between Monterrey and América,"Liga MX has always had controversy, parity, scandals and football. This year was no different, even more so in Apertura 2019.

* **It all started 6 months ago when on Reddit**, it was reported that [Lobos BUAP was bought by Ascenso MX club, FC Juarez](https://www.reddit.com/r/LigaMX/comments/bxmpqc/fc_juarez_buys_lobos_buap/). How you may ask? Essentially FC Juarez bought Lobos BUAP place in the first division. Terms were never officially disclosed. FC Juarez has a decent, low table finish even though they were expected to be at the way bottom along with Veracruz.
* **Speaking of Veracruz**, they have always been in and out of Liga MX and have history in the top flight of Mexican, but things finally imploded for them this tournament. Fidel Kuri Grajales, owner of Veracruz, had refused to pay his players, coaches and youth academy for a year or so and the players finally took a stand. This was a monumental decision by the players because of [pacto de caballeros](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acuerdo_de_caballeros&amp;prev=search) that has long mirred Liga MX. [Players across the league joined Veracruz in protest by not playing in the first minutes of their respective match.](https://www.latimes.com/espanol/deportes/articulo/2019-10-20/video-pumas-y-leon-se-solidarizaron-con-los-jugadores-del-veracruz) You think things couldn't get worse? Even during the actual protest of Veracruz during their match vs. Tigres, Tigres either didn't get the memo or refused to follow the agreement (many versions of this event) because [they started playing and scoring even though Veracruz was in a clear protest](https://streamable.com/6lee5). The match ended 3-1 in favor of Tigres, with Veracruz cussing the Tigres players off the pitch. Throughout the Apertura, Veracruz was avalanched by legal problems from the league and the state and ultimately disaffiliated from the league at the end of the regular season. The troubles haven't ended as players, coaches, team employees are still fighting for their unpaid wages. 
* **Cruz Azul is one of the ""4 Grandes (Big 4)""** clubs of  Mexico and after 22 years without a title and considerable investment in their squad, went into Apertura 2019 with high expectations of winning the title. After a poor start and sacking their manager, Pedro Caixinha, the apparent Vice president of the club, Victor Garces, went on Futbol Picante (think of it as Match of The Day in England but with low quality discussion) and [got in a fight on LIVE television](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD05M7bvx2o) with respected Sporting Director, Ricardo Pelaez, which ended in Pelaez resigning on Live Television. It was spectacular television watching a club implode in real time (in my opinion). Cruz Azul ended the season with club executives fighting over power to this present day and more importantly without making Liguilla (playoffs) and once again, disappointing their fans.
* **Atletico San Luis entered as the promoted, sweethearts owned by Atletico Madrid** from Ascenso MX into Liga MX and everything was good until apparently they fired their manager [due to remarks he made towards his players](https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/liga-mx/atletico-san-luis-despidio-alfonso-sosa-ofender-jugadores-revela-presidente) that were irreconcilable. There were rumors that he made homophobic remarks towards players that are homosexual, but no one ever confirmed specifics in this case. After sacking Sosa, Atletico San Luis hired Gustavo Matosas from the Costa Rican National Team because he was ""bored of international football"" - yes, really, he gave that reason. A few weeks after being in charge it didn't get better! [Matosas was sacked after rumors of him asking for percentages of transfers between a player(s) and his old clubs (Leon and America)](https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/liga-mx/gustavo-matosas-deja-director-tecnico-san-luis) surfaced and got all the way to Madrid. Atletico San Luis ended their season with a caretaker manager but not with the splash they wanted after being promoted from Ascenso MX. 
* J**orge Vergara, owner of a big 4 club, Chivas, passed away at the age of 64**. He had been battling an undisclosed illness (sources says cancer) for the better part of 2 years. Jorge Vergara was not only a HUGE influence in Liga MX and Chivas, but a HUGE influence in the Mexican National Team, MLS (Chivas USA) and Costa Rica (President of Saprissa. Say what you will about Jorge Vergara, he was a polarizing and controversial figure in the entire CONCACAF Region. He left his son, Amaury Vergara, in charge.
* **There were some MULTI-OWNERSHIP changes** with Tijuana now owning Queretaro and Santos Laguna owning the majority of Atlas. This after the league has taken a stand against multi ownership of clubs. Grupo Caliente (Tijuana) now own 3 clubs in the Mexican top 2 circuits, Dorados, Queretaro and Tijuana. Santos Laguna owns Atlas. How did this happen you ask? Lord knows if anyone knows. Shady stuff....
* **Across the league, 12 managers were sacked.**
* **Even with the negative storylines, the 2019 Apertura Liguilla has been spectacularly entertaining** with the top 4 (Leon, Queretaro, Tigres, Santos Laguna) seeds all being eliminated in the first round in close matches, with 4.5 goals scored PER MATCH. The First Leg between Morelia and Leon ended 3-3 after the match was stopped for a few minutes due to the ""Puto"" Chant used by Morelia fans. [The ref then gave 12 minutes of STOPPAGE TIME due to that and Morelia ended scoring a late game equalizer](https://www.fmfstateofmind.com/2019/11/27/20986548/2019-liga-mx-apertura-ida-match-recap-monarcas-morelia-3-leon-3-homophobic-chant-stops-play). Morelia would then go on and win the series but later be knocked off by Club America. Every match has had these stakes and has made for one of the most memorable Liguillas of all time. 
* **The Club World Cup is VERY important for Liga MX and its fans** and Monterrey gave of the best performances by a Mexican team ever, losing 2-1 Liverpool on a last second winner by Bobby Firmino and finishing in 3rd place after beating Al-Hilal.
* **If that wasn't enough,** [**Rogelio Funes Mori scored this GOLAZO**](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/eg6g5x/monterrey_21_club_america_rogelio_funes_mori/) **this past Wednesday in the first leg of the final** vs. Club America in the last minutes to gain a 2-1 lead heading in the 2nd leg at the Estadio Azteca. Absolutely bonkers

&amp;nbsp;

There was a lot of discussion lately about Mino Raiola with the transfert of Haaland, so I thought it was a good time to post this nice article/story about the man himself that help you understand better why players love him, why clubs hate him and why he's regarded as one of the best agent. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**JUST LIKE FAMILY
The dealings of Mino Raiola**

One day in Amsterdam in 2004, Zlatan Ibrahimović strapped on his gold watch, put on his Gucci leather jacket and drove his Porsche right up to the entrance of the five-star Okura Hotel. A frustrated young striker at Ajax, he was looking for a new agent, and had called Thijs Slegers, a journalist friend, for advice. Slegers had mentioned a guy named Mino Raiola, but with hesitation. 

“Why?” Zlatan had replied. 

“He’s a mafioso,” said Slegers. 

“Mafioso sounds good,” said Zlatan. 

The name rang a bell, for Raiola represented Maxwell, a teammate and friend of Zlatan at Ajax. The mafioso part might have been based on Italian stereotype. Born in Salerno, Raiola had moved with his family to the Dutch city of Haarlem in 1968, when he was one year old. There his father had opened a pizzeria, where Raiola worked. Exactly how Raiola had gone from waiting tables to representing footballers was still unknown to Zlatan. What Zlatan did know was that Raiola had contacts at the biggest clubs in Europe, that he was working with Pavel Nedvěd, and that people said he would do anything to get things his way. 

&amp;nbsp;

“All of which sounded good,” Zlatan wrote. “I didn’t want a nice guy.”

&amp;nbsp;

Zlatan walked inside the Okura Hotel and sat down in a sushi restaurant, where they had agreed to meet. As he waited, he envisaged a guy strolling through the door in a pinstripe suit. “But what did I see turn up?” Zlatan wrote. “A guy in jeans, a Nike T-shirt and with a stomach like one of the guys in the Sopranos.” 

Raiola, Zlatan realised, did not dress like a mafioso. He didn’t work like one. He wasn’t one. But he could act like one. As they began to talk, Raiola ditched the sushi and ordered pasta—enough to feed five people—which he wolfed down. Then Raiola pulled out four A4 sheets and showed them to Zlatan. 

&amp;nbsp;


* *Christian Vieri, 27 games, 24 goals*
 
* *Filippo Inzaghi, 25 games, 20 goals*

* *David Trezeguet, 24 games, 20 goals*
 
* *Zlatan Ibrahimović, 25 games, 5 goals*

&amp;nbsp;

“Do you think I’ll be able to sell you with stats like that?” Raiola said. 

Zlatan was taken aback. Raiola was right: those stats weren’t good. But Zlatan was… Zlatan. Nobody talked to him like that. 

Zlatan gathered his thoughts. “Had I scored twenty goals,” he countered, “even my mother could have sold me.” 

Raiola went quiet. But only for a bit. He highlighted the gold watch, the Gucci jacket, the Porsche—and told Zlatan he didn’t give a damn about it. Did Zlatan really want to be the world’s best? “Of course,” Zlatan replied. Then focus on the football, Raiola said, and the rest will come. 

Zlatan said he’d think about it. But when he got in the car, a buzz hit him. He called Raiola. 

“Listen,” Zlatan said. “I don’t want to wait. I want to begin working with you right away.”

A pause ensued. 

“All right,” Raiola said. “But if you’re going to work with me, you must do what I say.”

“Sure, absolutely.” 

“Sell your cars and your watches, and start training three times as hard. Because your stats are trash.”

Zlatan thought about it. “I should have told him to go to hell,” he wrote. But he knew Raiola was right. And so Zlatan did as Raiola said. He gave up his Porsche Turbo for a Fiat Stilo. He shelved his gold watch for a Nike one. He replaced the Gucci leather jacket with training gear. “I trained like a madman,” Zlatan wrote. Whenever he felt like letting up, Raiola was on him. 

“You’re not the best,” Raiola would say. “You’re a piece of crap. You’re nothing. You have to work harder.”

“Go f*** yourself,” said Zlatan. 

“F*** you,” said Raiola. 

&amp;nbsp;

Soon Zlatan was telling himself that he wasn’t working hard enough. But in August that year, he hit a wall. Doubt had surrounded his future, and at the Euros he had missed a spot kick as Sweden lost on penalties to the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Now Zlatan was taken off in a game against Utrecht, and kicked an advertising board. After the game he called Raiola and poured out his anger. But Raiola told him he had been terrible. They began to shout at each other. Zlatan hung up and drove home. 

When he came to his house, he saw a man standing outside his door. It was Raiola. Zlatan had not even climbed out of his car when they began to shout again. 

“I want out of here,” Zlatan said amid the arguing. 

“Guess you’ll just have to move to Turin then,” Raiola said. 

“What are you talking about?” 

Raiola, it turned out, was talking about Juventus. On his journey from waiter to agent, Raiola had learned some things. And he had gotten to know Luciano Moggi. 

&amp;nbsp;

Mino Raiola never actually baked pizza, but he did other stuff. “When I was eleven or twelve, I went to work with my dad to get to know him,” he told the Financial Times. His father worked up to twenty hours a day. “He was in the kitchen, so what could I do? I could wash up. I still like washing up. It gives me a sort of peace to clean things, to see the instant result of your work.”

As he grew older, Raiola waited tables and manned the bar. He became attuned to the needs of other people—not just what toppings they wanted, but if they were happy or sad. If a regular was getting divorced, Raiola would hear him out. “That restaurant was a social university,” he’d tell SportExpressen. Since Raiola spoke better Dutch than his father did, he began taking on business negotiations. Some regulars who worked as traders told him they were having trouble with Italian providers; the goods they had ordered would not arrive. Could Raiola help out? Raiola, who spoke Italian, put in a call and resolved the issue. Spotting a new market, he set up his own company, Intermezzo, to help Dutch people do business in Italy. 

Another habitué at the pizzeria was the president of HFC Haarlem, a club for whom Raiola had played in his teens. “I always told him he knew nothing about football,” Raiola told Secolo XIX. “One day he told me, ‘Listen, you try it then.’” In his early twenties, Raiola became the sporting director. But Haarlem lacked the money to sign the players he wanted, and he resigned. 

Yet Raiola liked working in football. He had dropped out of a law degree—that wasn’t for him. He had bought a McDonald’s and sold it to a property developer for millions, so he had money. Now he wanted to follow his passion. He spotted a legal loophole that enabled him to sell Dutch players to Italian clubs on the cheap. In the early 1990s, Raiola helped cut deals for a series of Ajax players, such as Dennis Bergkamp (to Inter), Wim Jonk (Inter) and Bryan Roy (Foggia). In Foggia, Raiola stayed with Roy for seven months and helped paint his house. There Raiola met his future wife and befriended the Foggia coach, Zdeněk Zeman. Raiola began to learn who ran clubs in Italy, and was unimpressed. “It’s a closed world, with gigantic potential, and a huge turnover of money,” Raiola told the FT. “But often managed by people of whom I think, ‘What the f***?’”

One of the executives Raiola encountered was Luciano Moggi, then a technical director at Torino. They were scheduled to meet at 11am. Raiola showed up at Moggi’s office at 10.45am. There he was ushered into a room where twenty-five people were also waiting for Moggi. Raiola left. Later that day he ran into Moggi at a restaurant. Raiola told the FT that their conversation went something like this:

“Are you Mr Moggi?” 

“Yes.”

“I find it very rude that you made me wait.”

“Who are you?”

“I am Raiola.”

“Ah, you’re Raiola. If you’re this unpleasant to me, you will never sell a player in Italy.”

But in the mid-1990s Raiola found Pavel Nedvěd, who played for Sparta Prague. In 1996, after the Czechs had reached the final of the Euros, Raiola sold Nedvěd to Lazio, now coached by Zeman. Raiola had never met a player who worked so hard, and considered Nedvěd a role model for his other clients. In 2000, Nedvěd helped Lazio win the scudetto. A year later, Moggi, now at Juventus, wanted to sign Nedvěd. 

Raiola was planning to sell him to Real Madrid. But he agreed to meet Moggi in Turin, just to hear what he had to say. What Raiola did not expect was that Moggi would invite a horde of journalists and photographers to the rendezvous. Once news of the event hit the papers, everyone expected Nedvěd to join Juve, and so he did. Juve won the next two league titles, and Nedvěd earned the Ballon d’Or in 2003. All of which meant that a year later, when Zlatan wanted out of Ajax, Raiola was on good terms with Moggi. 

Raiola and Zlatan were set to meet Moggi in a VIP-room at the airport near Monaco. This, however, was at the same time as the Monaco Grand Prix, and their car got stuck in traffic. Raiola and Zlatan had to sprint to the meeting. When they arrived, Raiola was drenched in sweat. He was wearing a Nike T-shirt, trainers without socks, and Hawaiian beach shorts. They entered a room filled with smoke, where Moggi sat chewing on a fat cigar. 

“What the hell are you wearing,” said Moggi. 

“Are we here to talk about my appearance or what?” said Raiola. 

Everybody wanted a deal. But as August drew to a close, talks ground to a halt. Moggi suddenly said that Zlatan and Trezeguet couldn’t play together. Infuriated, Raiola invited Moggi and Fabio Capello to dinner, where he put the argument to Capello. Capello replied that of course the two could play together, leaving Moggi with little to say. 

Right before the transfer window closed, however, the deal was still not done. Juventus were haggling with Ajax. With the clock ticking fast, Raiola and Zlatan flew to the offices of the Italian Football Federation, in Milan, where transfers are registered. There Moggi was trying to bring the price down, while Raiola had the Ajax board on the line. Ajax did not want to confirm the deal because Juve did not offer a bank guarantee. Now Raiola was screaming threats at Ajax. “If you don’t sign, you won’t get €16m,” he said. “You won’t get Zlatan. You won’t get nothing. Get it? Nothing!” Yet Ajax did not budge. The tension hung in the air.

At that point Raiola found a football and began doing keepy-uppies. Zlatan couldn’t believe it. The ball was flying around, hitting Moggi on the head. Just as the whole deal was about to fall apart, Raiola appeared to have decided to become a street artist. 

“It was crazy,” Zlatan wrote. “What was he doing?”

Yet somehow, at the last minute, Ajax signed the papers. Zlatan was going to Juventus. And Raiola had his deal. 

Today Raiola rivals Jorge Mendes as the top agent in football. Last year Forbes put Raiola fifth among all agents in sport. He represents Zlatan, Paul Pogba, Marco Verratti, Mario Balotelli, Blaise Matuidi, Gianluigi Donnarumma, and others. Though based in Monaco, Raiola spends most of his time flying around Europe to meet players and directors. He speaks Italian, Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. He does a lot of business in Italy and the Netherlands, but not in Germany, where the directors are, he believes, unprofessional. “This is shown by the fact that some of them ask ‘Mino who?’ when I call,” Raiola told 11 Freunde. “With all due respect: a sports director who doesn’t know Mino Raiola, should be looking for another job.”

Raiola claims he never approaches players; they approach him. When he meets a potential client, he sets out his plans. “And then it has to click,” Raiola told 11 Freunde. “The chemistry has to be right, otherwise it makes no sense.” 

In 2015 he met Lukaku and his father in Brussels. Lukaku had just moved to Everton, a club Raiola said he would not be playing for had they met a year earlier. Raiola then assessed Lukaku. “He said stuff to me that no one would say,” Lukaku told The Guardian. “Mean things like, ‘You play like a woman, you play like a girl who has never played the game before. You are too timid.’ Then he would take examples of Zlatan and Bergkamp, all those players, and say, ‘You want to aim for the top? Well, you are not playing like a top player.’

“I love Mino, I love his character. He is not a big talker, more like a brother and a friend. We rarely speak about football, and that is nice, but when I am not doing well, the phone will ring…”

What enables Raiola to make such calls is that he handles his clients in person. Whereas Mendes relies on a global network of scouts and advisors, Raiola works alone. During interviews Raiola will interrupt journalists to answer the phone. Some players call twice a month, others twice a day. Some need a jolt, others sympathy. Some want advice about their game, others about investments or personal issues. “To him they are like family,” Slegers told The Guardian. “And that’s why he’s the perfect negotiator, because you always want to do the best for your family. He has a good sense of humour and he likes to be provocative, but in a way that is quite funny. Some people think he is cocky and, if you don’t know him and maybe you just see his quotations, you can think he is crazy. But he is not. He stands up for his players.”

Players respond to Raiola because he cares only about them. Raiola will court, criticise and browbeat anyone—coaches, directors, journalists—if it is for the best of his players. He seems to fear nobody. When Zlatan entered talks about a new contract at Juve, Raiola walked into Moggi’s office, sat down in his chair and put his feet on his desk. Moggi came in with his cigar. 

“What the hell, are you sitting in my seat?” Moggi said. 

“Sit down so that we can begin talking,” Raiola replied. 

Another who has struggled with Raiola is Sir Alex Ferguson. When Raiola had begun to work with Pogba, a teenager in the Manchester United reserves, he had told him he was underpaid. Pogba and Raiola met Ferguson to say they would not sign a new contract unless he got a raise. 

“This is an offer that my chihuahuas don’t sign,” Raiola told Ferguson. 

“What do you think he needs to earn?” Ferguson said. 

“Not that,” Raiola said. 

Raiola took Pogba out of United, gave him to Juventus, and sold him back to United four years later for €105m, of which €27m reportedly went into his own pocket. Ferguson later wrote that he distrusted Raiola “from the moment I met him”. For his part Raiola would reflect on the rumour that Ferguson had never hated anyone but him. “It’s a great compliment,” Raiola told GQ Italia. “If you have no enemies, you have not done your work well.”

There is a rumour that Raiola takes ten percent of each transfer that involves his players, but Raiola told 11 Freunde that the size can vary. He might take fifty percent, or nothing at all. When Raiola pushes a deal, it’s usually for a strategic reason. The player might be undervalued (Pogba). The player might want to join a bigger club (Zlatan). Or Raiola might have anticipated that the club is about to sink. In 2017, for instance, Raiola warned Donnarumma against extending his contract at AC Milan because he did not trust the directors. 

Such predictions can force a player to change clubs against his will. In 2012, Raiola arranged for Zlatan to leave Milan. Zlatan didn’t want to, but Raiola foresaw that the Italian football economy would decline, and thought Milan would soon be unable to pay his wages. On the other hand, Paris Saint-Germain had been bought by Qatar. The wage demands Zlatan gave to PSG were so big that Zlatan himself thought they would never agree. After twenty minutes, they had. Zlatan left and earned a fortune. Milan have not been in the title race since. 

Raiola does not always manage to convince his players. When Pogba left United, Raiola tried to dissuade him from joining Juve because he felt they rarely played youngsters. Pogba joined anyway because he wanted the biggest challenge. In the case of Balotelli, Raiola has often decided his next club, but not always managed to get him to stay put. Raiola says the biggest mistake he has made with Balotelli was to let him leave Manchester City in 2013. “Mario was unhappy,” Raiola told The Daily Mail. “I should have said. ‘You’re feeling s***? You don’t like your job? Tough, grow up, get on with it.’ I needed to be cruel to be kind, but I was too nice.”

That wasn’t the last time Balotelli defied Raiola. When Balotelli wanted to go to Nice in 2016, he and Raiola were about to meet the club president, Jean-Pierre Rivère. But Balotelli was late, and so Raiola set out to explain to Rivère why he should not sign him. When Balotelli turned up, Raiola told him: “Everything bad I had to say about you to the president, I have said.” Nice signed Balotelli anyway. 

Balotelli has not turned out as Raiola had hoped, nor has Lukaku, who left him last year. But Raiola is stocking up on new talent. He represents several Dutch youngsters, one being Justin Kluivert. Still, the jewel in the crown remains Zlatan. Raiola has said that he sees Zlatan as the player he himself would have been, had he had an athletic body, and he seems to dread the day Zlatan hangs up his boots. When Zlatan was rumoured to retire, in 2016, Raiola told Radio Monte Carlo that he’d lock him up in a cell until he changed his mind. “If he retires,” Raiola said, “it would be like somebody stealing the Mona Lisa.”

When Raiola met Zlatan at the Okura Hotel, he used Nedvěd as a reference point. When Raiola meets young players now, he uses Zlatan. Two years ago Raiola told SportExpressen that their relationship would outlast Zlatan’s playing career, even if it still got turbulent at times. “We can fight,” Raiola said. “If we don’t fight, we’re no longer friends.”

“I obviously made him,” Raiola continued. “I say that now so that he hears it in Sweden. He will of course say that he made me. Perhaps the truth is that we made each other.”

“What’s the best advice you have given Zlatan?” the journalist asked. 

“To listen to me,” Raiola said.",soccer,1577700132,TeKaeS,33,1,True,2019-12-30

We play in a shitty half abandoned training ground outside the city, with lighting that isn't good enough to play in the evenings so we get fridays at 12pm, a time that doesn't work for schoolkids. The team constantly has inept managers and players on 1 year contracts who only pay for the paychecks yet never get let go. They refuse to advertise the team or games, and despite repeated requests by us fans to do the bare minimum and open a facebook page and a website for the team they won't do that. There isn't even a fuckin bus to the stadium. 

Us small amount of dedicated fans have tried everything, meetings with the management, petitions, open letters and writing to the press, and all we get is lies (""we offered the fans at the beginning of the season to open a website and facebook page and they refused"") and shitty excuses (""the team is young, only 10 years old"" - bullshit, younger clubs with less money behind them are at the top of the 2nd division).

364,Exclusive: Mino Raiola hits back at Manchester United over Erling Haaland transfer claims Source https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/12/30/exclusive-mino-raiola-disappointed-manchester-united-erling/,"**Key Quote **

“I do not know if Manchester United are briefing this but if they are then they are covering their own loss and that I find strange and disappointing,” Raiola said

**Summary**

1. Raiola also revealed that Haaland had more contact with United than any other club, including meetings with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and that it was the 19-year-old’s choice to join Borussia Dortmund because he felt it was a better club to further his career “at this time”.

He has made his choice and we went through a normal process.” It was announced on Sunday that Borussia Dortmund had beaten a number of leading clubs, including United, Juventus and RB Leipzig, to sign Haaland from the Austrian champions RB Salzburg after meeting the 20million euro (£17.1million) buy-out clause in his contract.

If he wanted to go to Manchester United I would have been obliged to take him to Manchester United but he did not.” Raiola added that some young players may prefer not to go to the Premier League at any early stage of their career and pointed out that Haaland’s new team-mate at Dortmund, Jadon Sancho, who is also a United target, had left England in search of first-team football.

Raiola also told Telegraph Sport that contrary to suggestions he – and Haaland’s father Alf Inge Haaland who also represents him – did not try to insist on a buy-out clause in the Norwegian striker’s contract and that, instead, United should question why one of European football’s most exciting young talents chose not to join them.

“I do not know if Manchester United are briefing this but if they are then they are covering their own loss and that I find strange and disappointing,” Raiola said over the claims of insisting on a buy-out clause and other demands leading to the transfer to Old Trafford not happening.

Mino Raiola has dismissed claims that Manchester United withdrew from the race to sign Erling Haaland because they grew frustrated over the agent’s demands during negotiations.

The news was a significant blow to United and Solskjaer who flew to Salzburg to meet with Haaland earlier this month in the hope of tying up a deal but the player, who worked under the United manager for 18 months at Molde, has decided his interests will be best served by a move to Germany from Austria.

Raiola pointed out that Haaland knew Solskjaer well and that the United manager is also a former team-mate of the player’s father for the Norwegian national team.

“When you are 19 then maybe you prefer not to go to the Premier League,” Raiola said adding: “The offer from Manchester United was good.

“The club that he had the most direct contact with him was Manchester United,” Raiola said.

Haaland has agreed a 4½-year contract with Dortmund that ties him to the Bundesliga club until June 2024.

He chose Borussia Dortmund ahead of them and other clubs and I’m very happy because he is going to the club he wanted to go to and that is best for him right now.

There is nothing against Manchester United or Ole.

“Clearly he (Erling Haaland) felt that at this moment it was not the right step in his career.

If they want to blame someone then, fine, blame me but the player is happy.

It was just a normal negotiation and the player has chosen a different path.

“There was no fall-out between me and (United executive vice-chairman) Ed Woodward.

They are also both friends from their playing days in England.

Here's my suggestion to change it:
Step 1: is it clear offiside? 
Yes - Give offside. 
No - refer to referee who goes to monitor.

Step 2: Referee views and decides on the following:
- Did it give a clear advantage to the attacker?
- Or did the defending team interfere or have a chance to reclaim the ball following the initial offside?

The Wolves disallowed goal is a prime example. The attacker was maybe 1-2cm offside, then actually turned away from goal. The resulting cross then hit at least one Liverpool player before reaching the scorer.

493,2010-2019: A Retrospective of the Decade That Was In Liga MX.,"As we exit the 2010's and go in the '20's, I have compiled some stats from the past decade of Liga MX. If you want to see more stats let me know and I will do research and update the post.

 

Championships in the Decade:

────────

 

Tigres UANL (5) 

 

Two tied with 3:

 

America (3) 

Santos Laguna (3) 

 

Three tied with 2:

 

Monterrey (2)

Toluca (2)

Leon (2)

 

Five tied with 1:

 

Pachuca (1)

Chivas (1)

UNAM (1)

Tijuana (1)

Toluca (1)

 

Tigres UANL led the league with 5 titles followed by America and Santos Laguna lifting the trophy 3 times.

────────

Most Points:

────────

 

A Visual Look at the Amount of Points Earned This Decade

 

 1. Tigres UANL: 568

 2. Monterrey: 560

 3. America: 549

 

These 3 teams were the most dominant in the decade when it comes to cumulative points earned. They are the only teams to clear 500 points. The 4th place was Santos Laguna with a distant 499 a full 50 points behind.

────────

Most Liguillas Made:

────────

 

 1. America (17)

 2. Tigres UANL (16)

 3. Monterrey (15)* (Monterrey finished 9th in the Clausura 2013 but 8th seed Queretaro was relegated and was unable to play in the Liguilla)

 

Once again Tigres, Monterrey and America dominated this stat. The next closest team was Monarcas Morelia with 11 liguillas made. 2 years worth of tournaments separated the top 3 and the rest of the league.

────────

Most Consecutive Liguillas Made:

────────

 

 1. Tigres UANL (13) *Active Streak

 2. America (9)

 3. Monterrey (6)

 

No surprises here. The same 3 teams had the longest streaks in the decade. 4th place was Morelia with 5 consecutive Liguillas.

 

On the flip side, the most consecutive tournaments without a Liguilla were:

 

 1. Puebla (10)

 2. Veracruz (8)

 3. 3 teams tied with 6: Cruz Azul, Tijuana, and Queretaro

────────

Most Super-Lideratos:

────────

 

 1. Tigres, Monterrey, Cruz Azul (3)

 2. America, Toluca, Santos, Tijuana (2)

 3. Chivas, UNAM, Leon (1)

 

Not a dominant team as it was spread out in this category. Tigres, Cruz Azul, and Monterrey had 3 with several teams tied with 2 and 1 a piece.

 2. (8)

An interesting stat. The second seed was the most successful with 8 titles followed by the third seed at 4. Also to note there was no number 7 seed winner this decade and there has never been a number six seed win the Liguilla. 

────────

Most Finals Made in the Decade:

────────

 

 1. Tigres UANL (7) 5 titles, 2 sub titles.

 2. America/Santos (6) both had 3 titles and 3 sub titles.

 3. Monterrey (5) 2 titles, 3 sub titles.

And now a look at each team that played in Liga MX in the 2010's. In order by points won.

────────

 

TIGRES UANL:

 

Titles: (5) AP 2011, AP 2015, AP 2016, AP 2017, CL 2019

Sub Titles: (2) AP 2014, CL 2017

Points: 568

Liguillas Made: 16

Liguilla Streak: 13

Super Lider: 3

 

This was Tigres decade. After 29 years of a title drought they lifted the trophy 5 times, had 2 loses in the final and also had a Final Appearance in the Libertadores which they lost to River Plate. Lead by Andre Pierre Gignac Tigres has established itself as one of the premier teams in Liga MX. With Tuca set to step down in the immediate future, will Tigres be as successful as they were in the 2010's. Time will tell.

 

RAYADOS DE MONTERREY:

 

Titles: (2) AP 2010, AP 2019

Sub Titles: (3) CL 2012, CL 2016, AP 2017

Points: 560

Liguillas Made: 15

Liguilla Streak: 6

Super Lider: 3

 

Monterrey has become a focal point of Mexican Football. Armed with the most expensive roster and a myriad of stars, Monterrey finally ended an almost 10 year title drought beating America in the 2019 Apertura final. With no end in sight to quality players arriving, Monterrey will be a favorite to win the title every season in the following decade.

 

AGUILAS DEL AMERICA:

 

Titles: (3) AP 2013, AP 2014, AP 2018

Sub Titles: (3) AP 2013, AP 2015, AP 2019

Points: 549

Liguillas Made: 17

Liguilla Streak: 9

Super Lider: 2

 

Unquestionably Mexico's biggest team, America has maintained itself as a top club winning 3 titles in the decade and becoming the winningest team in the process with 13 Liga MX Championships. Heading into the next decade, America will remain a fixture of Mexican Football and will certainly add more silverware before the 20's end.

 

SANTOS LAGUNA:

 

Titles: (3) CL 2012, CL 2015, CL 2018

Sub Titles: (3) BI 2010, AP 2010, AP 2011

Points: 499

Liguillas Made: 12

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: 2

 

A team with 36 years of existence, Santos has won an impressive 6 titles in their short history. The club lately has become a team with home grown talent as opposed to years past when they had a big budget. No matter their formula, Santos for the most part has been in the hunt for the title. As a new decade approaches, we'll see wether they can maintain thier success.

 

CRUZ AZUL: 

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (2) AP 2013, AP 2018

Points: 494

Liguillas: 10

Liguilla Streak: 3

Super Lider: 3

 

Where to start with Cruz Azul. In the midst of a 22 year title drought, Cruz Azul came close twice losing to arch-rival, America, twice this decade. A heartbreaking loss in the Apertura 2013 final still haunts the team, as America goalkeeper Moises Munoz famously headed in the tying goal in added time to send the game to penalties where America would win. With turmoil and a change at the squad's leadership, will Cruz Azul have a third straight decade without a title? 

 

DIABLOS ROJOS DEL TOLUCA:

 

Titles: (1) BI 2010

Sub Titles: (2) AP 2012, CL 2018

Points: 485

Liguillas: 9

Liguilla Streak: 4

Super Lider: 2

 

As the 2000's closed, Toluca had just had a dominant decade. With great offensive teams led by the likes of Cardozo, Vicente Sanchez, and Sinha, Toluca set the league on fire. The 2010's however proved to be difficult. While contending almost every year Toluca only won one title and also lost two finals. Still, they are bound to once again be a club that has the potential to be in the hunt every year.

 

TUZOS DEL PACHUCA:

 

Titles: (1) CL 2016

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 455

Liguillas: 8

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: 0

 

Pachuca has become Mexico's Power Plant, producing top tier players and exporting them to Europe. Hector Herrera, Chucky Lozano, and Erick Gutierrez have established themselves in Europe and Pachuca has savvy leadership that will most likely keep producing talent. While the titles have slowed down ater a fantastic 2000's run they still command respect and figure to fight for liguilla spots every tournament.

 

PUMAS UNAM:

 

Titles: (1) CL 2011

Sub Titles: (1) AP 2015

Points: 447

Liguillas: 9

Liguilla Streak: 3

Super Lider: 2

 

Pumas historically has produced home grown talent that has kept them in the mix for the title. Lately, however, their well has run dry. It'll be interesting to see wether they can revive thier academy and return to consistent success. 

 

MONARCAS MORELIA:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (1) CL 2011

Points: 427

Liguillas: 11

Liguilla Streak: 5

Super Lider: 0

 

Morelia started strong this decade. Losing a final in 2011 and making a string of consecutive Liguillas. Hard times ensued however and the team struggled for much of the following years, nearly avoiding relegation in 2017 after a miracle goal in added time by Ruidiaz at Monterrey to secure thier stay. They had thier most successful campaign in the Apertua 2019 making it to the semifinals.

 

CHIVAS DE GUADALAJARA:

 

Titles: (1) CL 2017

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 389

Liguillas: 7

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: 1

 

Mexico's second most winningest team had a rough decade. While they had a Double in 2016 winning both the League and Cup, Chivas at one point was second to last in the relegation table only above lowly Veracruz. With strong signings this offseason, Chivabros are optimistic the worst years are behind them for a storied club.

 

PANZAS VERDES DE LEON:

 

Titles: (2) AP 2013, CL 2014

Sub Titles: (1) CL 2019

Points: 386

Liguillas: 8 

Liguilla Streak: 3

Super Lider: 1

 

Leon came back with a roar (pun intended) tonLiga MX after a lengthy stay in the Ascension League. Winning two titles and becoming the last team to achieve back to back titles. They have remained a force and have entrenched themselves in the top places of the relegation table where they figure to remain. With a new stadium in the works, they'll be a top team in the 20's.

 

GALLOS BLANCOS DE QUERETARO:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (1) CL 2015

Points: 386

Liguillas: 5* (They made the liguilla in 2013, which would have made it 6 but were not allowed to play as they were relegated. 9th seed Monterrey was then inserted into the Liguilla.)

Liguilla Streak: 1

Super Lider: 0

 

Queretaro has had several delegations but have found a way ($$$$$) to return to Liga MX. They made a final in 2015 and had a successful Apertura 2015. The goal for the sub is to distance themselves from the bottom of the relegation table. A serious effort has been made to their infrastructure from the youth teams up so there is hope for the fans.

 

XOLOS DE TIJUANA:

 

Titles: (1) AP 2012 

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 380

Liguillas: 6

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: 2

 

Tijuana quickly established itself in Liga MX winning the title in 2012, a year after being promoted to the top flight in Mexican Football. With a stadium that's still being upgraded and a rabid and loyal fanbase, Tijuana is poised to have a successful decade. 

 

LOS ZORROS DEL ATLAS:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 377

Liguillas: 5

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: 0

 

A historic club that hasn't won a title since 1951, Atlas nonetheless has a loyal fanbase. A historically strong youth development franchise, they have groomed some of the best Mexican Footballers in Mexican history like Rafael Marquez and Andres Guardado. Will they finally break trough in the 20's is uncertain but thier fans deserve better.

 

PUEBLA FC:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 372

Liguillas: 1

Liguilla Streak: 1

Super Lider: 0

 

One of the most consistently mediocre teams in Liga MX, Puebla nonetheless has been able to remain in Liga MX after a dreadful 2000's that saw them descend for a couple of years. Ownership will have to find a way to make the club better if they want to remain in Liga MX.

 

JAGUARES DE CHIAPAS:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Liguillas: 5

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: 0

 

A now defunct club, Chiapas had two versions when they descended once, only to buy newly promoted San Luis to replace the first version after Queretaro bought the team (only in Liga MX) to remain in the top flight. While they had several successful campaigns, Chiapas once again descended in 2017 in the Morelia miracle and was soon disbanded.

 

RAYOS DEL NECAXA:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 198

Liguillas: 3

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: 0

 

A team that had great success in the 90's and 2000's Necaxa found themselves in the Ascension League for a long while, eventually relocating from Mexico City to Aguascalientes. When they returned, Necaxa has had a couple of good seasons that have left them in the upper mid positions of the relegation table. 

 

TIBURONES ROJOS DE VERACRUZ:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 187

Liguillas: 2

Liguilla Streak: 2

Super Lider: LOL

 

What can be said that hasn't already being said about Veracruz. One of the original teams in Liga MX, Veracruz has descended several times only to find a way to return. Its latest incarnation had a disastrous end with the tea achieving only 8 points in the calendar year due to bad play and sanctions for non payment due to players. After the Apertura 2019 the team was dissolved and the future of the name and logo remain in limbo. 

 

POTROS DE HIERRO DEL ATLANTE:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 139

Liguillas: 1

Liguilla Streak: 1

Sub Lider: 0

 

Once a cornerstone of Mexican Football, Atlante has flounder in the Ascension League since 2013. Will they ever make it back? They won a title in 2007 but quickly devolved in quality. There has been word of thier return to Mexico City from Cancun, but nothing has materialized.

 

REAL SAN LUIS:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 128

Liguillas: 1

Liguilla Streak: 1

Super Lider: 0

 

San Luis's former iteration held on to a place in Liga MX for a very short two stints eventually being relegated 2 times in less then 4 years. After remaining in the Ascension League for years, the team was bought and moved to Chiapas after a series of moves that saw Queretaro buy Chiapas, Chiapas buying San Luis to replace their team, and Veracruz buying newly promoted La Piedad to bring back Veracruz to the top flight... only in Liga MX.

 

ESTUDIANTES TECOS:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 81

Liguillas: 0

Liguilla Streak: 0

Super Lider: 0

 

Tecos has the distinction of being the only club in Mexico to have ascended from the third division all the way up to the top flight and won a Liga MX title. Though they were relegated early in the decade and later dissolved, Tecos now has returned and currently play in the Second Division (Third Tier) after being promoted from the Third Division (Fourth Tier) recently.

 

LOBOS BUAP:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 71

Liguillas: 0

Liguilla Streak: 0

Super Lider: 0

 

A team that remained in Liga MX for 2 years, being relegated after thier first season and the paying $6 million USD to remain, Lobos place would eventually be sold to Bravos de Juarez making way for football to return to Ciudad Juarez.

 

LEONÉS NEGROS DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DE GUADALAJARA:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 35

Liguillas: 0

Liguilla Streak: 0

Super Lider: 0

 

A team with previous roots in the top flight, Leones has largely remain in the lower divisions. They had a cup of coffee back this decade but were relegated back after only one year. Often in the mix for an Ascension Title, we'll see if they can come back up.

 

DORADOS DE SINALOA:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 29

Liguillas: 0

Liguilla Streak: 0

Super Lider: 0

 

A constant powerhouse in the Ascension League, Dorados have failed to maintain a spot in Liga MX ascending twice and being relegated twice very quickly both times. Still, with constant trips to the playoffs in the Ascension League, smart bet would be that they find themselves back in Liga MX in the next 10 years.

 

ATLETICO SAN LUIS:

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Liguillas: 0

Liguilla Streak: 0

Super Lider: 0

 

Top Flight Football has returned to San Luis Potosi. Backed by Atletico Madrid, San Luis has a solid future in Liga MX. They had an ok first tournament that was marred by a riot erupting against heated rival Queretaro that saw thier stadium being banned for a game.

 

BRAVOS DE JUAREZ

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 18

Liguillas: 0

Liguilla Streak: 0

Super Lider: 0

 

Ciudad Juarez also got Liga MX football back this year. Buying Lobos BUAP place in the league Juarez has a serious ownership that wants to establish themselves. Time will tell. The fanbase is there to support the club.

 

INDIOS DE CIUDAD JUAREZ

 

Titles: (0)

Sub Titles: (0)

Points: 15

Liguillas: 0

Liguilla Streak: 0

Super Lider: 0

 

Ciudad Juarez's first team had thier first taste of Liga MX Football in the late 2000's eventually being relegated in 2010. The team then was affiliated with the University of Ciudad Juarez being eventually dissolved in 2016.

────────

 

There you have it. A quick glimpse into the decade that was in Liga MX. For all the faults the league has, it is unquestionably as exciting as any league in the world. As they seek to branch out and become more international, hopefully the league will expand its borders and reach a bigger audience. 

I will be doing a follow up with a look at all the finals that took place in the 2010's from the Bicentenario 2010 won by Toluca to the Apertura 2019 won by Rayados. 

Cheers.

England legend David Beckham believes Qatar will host a unique version of the FIFA World Cup that inspires future generations.

During a visit to Education City Stadium – exactly three years before the Qatar 2022 final will take place – the former Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan, LA Galaxy and Paris Saint-Germain star said Qatar's tournament will be 'a dream' for players and fans thanks to its friendliness and state-of-the-art facilities.

""I think as a player and a fan you want to visit a World Cup competition with great facilities, safe facilities, great hotels and great culture – and that's what Qatar is all about,"" said Beckham, who was given a tour of Education City Stadium by Hassan Al Thawadi, Secretary General of the Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy.

He continued: ""I wish I was still playing because to play in stadiums like this, it's a dream. Players are going to be spoilt here.""

Beckham, who won 115 caps for England, said it is important to take the World Cup to new countries.

""That's what the World Cup is all about – giving countries the chance to host the biggest competition in the game. It changes economies, changes people's lives, changes fan experiences and gives people an opportunity to experience football in places you wouldn't expect to visit. It's given Qatar an opportunity to do something that's so special and, as you see, something unique is really being created here.""

A regular visitor to Qatar in recent years, Beckham said he had seen the country rapidly evolve.

""I've been here quite a few times and I've seen the change and development,"" said Beckham, who was visiting to attend the FIFA Club World Cup semi-final between CF Monterrey and Liverpool FC at Khalifa International Stadium.

""Most importantly, it's always been such a family environment here – and I think that is something as a player and a fan you really want at a World Cup. Three years to the day \[until the World Cup final\] it's going to be pretty incredible.""

Beckham, who won 19 major trophies during a glittering 20-year playing career, added that Qatar 2022 will inspire young people across the country and around the world.

""I think that's the greatest thing about the World Cup – it inspires future generations,"" he continued. ""There will be a lot of children in Qatar seeing their own national team playing games and saying 'maybe that can be me one day'.""

Al Thawadi took the chance to thank Beckham for visiting Education City Stadium, which will become the third tournament venue to be unveiled when it opens in early 2020.

""It was a pleasure to welcome David to Qatar and show him round our latest tournament venue, Education City Stadium. It was wonderful to hear him say how impressed he is with the stadium and that he's excited about the World Cup being hosted in the Middle East and Arab world for the first time. I look forward to seeing David again over the coming years and, of course, during the tournament.""",soccer,1576788713,JV_info,30,1,True,2019-12-19

202,"[Official] Javier Tebas announced as La Liga president again after his resignation couple weeks ago. Tebas was supported by 36 out of 42 Primera and Segunda clubs while all 4 Socios owned clubs (Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao, Osasuna) were against his candidature.","La Liga has announced that Javier Tebas has been declared interim president. Final confirmation of the Spaniard's return to this post will be announced after Christmas.

Let us recall that in early December, Tebas resigned, although his second mandate was valid until October 2020. However the Spaniard argued that La Liga needed a stable mandate for its helmsman the following year because of important events, including, amongst others, the negotiation of a television contract for Spain for 2022-2025.

By Tuesday the applications of the candidates who had to collect more than 25% of the guarantors from the 42 Primera and Segunda clubs that make up La Liga were awaiting, which means that the candidate had to collect at least 11 guarantees. Finally, depending on the source, it is reported that Tebas gathered from 34 to 36 guarantors and became the only candidate proposed. The clubs that did not show his support are to be Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletic, Osasuna or Zaragoza.

Therefore, La Liga has officially announced that after the examination and approval of Tebas' candidacy, he is proclaiming him interim president of La Liga and is waiting for applications opposing this decision from Thursday to Monday. If no one reports such a negative opinion, the Election Committee will at its next meeting, not before 20:00 on 23 December at the earliest, declare Tebas President of the La Liga permanently. The next meeting of the Commission was initially set for December 27th, and it is then that the Spaniard will once again take the lead in the organisation in full, receiving a 4-year mandate.",soccer,1576840460,kazcmot,18,1,True,2019-12-20
217,"Decade in Review, Day 9: Moments","On the ninth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Nine Raymond Wilkins.

Football matches are long. Seriously long. Watching the average match means taking at least two hours out of your day, without any guarantee that it’s actually worth it. But even in a drab 0-0 draw in which neither side looks capable of scoring a goal while the players hopelessly bumble about, there may be small moments you’ll never forget. That’s part of the attraction, and that’s part of today’s retrospective here: The incidents, big and small, on and off the pitch, that you’ll remember from this decade.

What could those be, you ask? Anything, really: That player on your team you hate with a passion finally being called for a foul throw, adding further evidence backing up your position that they’re a massive fraud stealing a living. That streaker giving the stewards a good workout and making the players crack up in the process. A player trying to celebrate a goal by smashing the ball back into the net, only to tragically miss - or hit the post and smash the ball into his own face. Or it could be much less light-hearted: a player suffering a serious, career-threatening injury you can’t see a replay of without welling up or getting queasy. 

And let’s not limit ourselves to moments happening on the pitch here, either, because for every game being played there’s an endless amount of media coverage. And it’s that media coverage often highlighting funny, tragic, or outright bizarre things happening in the wider world of football. A world-famous footballer having to apologize for calling France a “shit country” is as much a moment to remember as a manager calling an unfortunate reporter an ostrich or an England manager being booted out after just 67 days over corruption allegations.

And as much as I’d like to keep this whole review series light and cheerful, there are quite a few less than happy moments to look back on. Between all the joy football brings us, there’ll always be the despair it can cause. We’ve seen a well-liked international manager [commit suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Speed); the ugly side of the game rearing its head between all the corruption, violence and even slavery; we’ve seen not just careers [but lives changed forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelhak_Nouri) in front of our eyes; and [whole clubs being almost wiped out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMia_Flight_2933) through disaster.

* Which moments, both good and bad, funny and tragic, small and big will stick in your mind forever? 
* Which interview made you laugh so hard you had struggle breathing? 
* Whose ineptitude at playing football made you almost lose your mind in disbelief?

Scott McIntyre is one of the most prominent and talented journalists that cover Asian football. Scott and I were hosted on a podcast to talk about Asian football a few years ago and I have been following his work ever since.  

Scott worked for SBS in Australia, as well as writing for the Guardian, TRT, and many other outlets around the world. He always stood up for what he believed was right. He made headlines in Australia a few years ago for criticizing the Australian army for their atrocities in Japan during the second world war, a move that cost him his job with SBS.

------

**What happened?**

Scott is married to Japanese women and has two children. Since May, his wife has taken his children back to Japan with her without his consent, and he is yet to hear or know where they are. This issue is not unique to Scott, as Japanese police and courts refuse to tell parents where their children are once a Japanese spouse takes them with them. This constitues child abduction and abuse, as kids have the right to be with both their parents. Scott's wife hasn't been granted full custody by either Japanese or Australian courts and has no legal basis for what she is doing. However, Japanese law enforcement has not allowed parents to know the location of their children. 

Scott travelled to Japan in hopes of tracking them down and was arrested due to illegal entry to a common area when he went to his parents in law's house. He is being kept in a room that is lit 24 hours a day and is allowed on bath every five days. Both those things are not allowed according to the United Nations standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners (Mandela Rules). 
Scott will spend Christmas and new year in his cell as Japanese laws allow for people to be imprisoned for 23 days and question them **without their lawyers** before facing a prosecutor and heading to court. This means that Scott is spending time in Jail and is being tortured for something that he hasn't been convicted of by a court of law. 

---- 

**How can we help?**

If you live in Australia, I highly encourage you to contact Marise Payne, the foreign minister on this email and let her know about your disapproval of the treatment Scott is receiving 
foreign.minister@dfat.gov.au

You can also sign this petition, calling for Australia to treat retaining a child overseas without the consent of both parents m as a criminal act. 

If you are not Australian, you can contact your own foreign minister, and appeal to them to pressure Japan to recognise a child's right to have both their parents. If you think this is useless, then think again, within the past four months both the French president and Italian PM have held discussion with the Japanese PM over this issue due to pressure by parents who are in a similar situation. Media attention has been slowly spreading about this issue and world leaders are starting to act.

You can also spread around [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/former-sbs-reporter-scott-mcintyre-arrested-in-japan-reportedly-over-search-for-his-children) by the guardian on Scott's situation on social media to raise awareness.

# Appetizers

* Lille comfortably beat Brest friday in the matchday opener, even if the score (1-0) makes it less obvious than it was. But with 10 shots on target to 0, it could have been way worse for Brest without a great Larsonneur between the posts. WIth that win, Lille reaches the podium for the third time this season.
* Having two players sent off before half time doesn't make things easier. That's what Nîmes experienced against Lyon. Reduced to ten players after only 5 minutes due to a [high foot from Theo Valls](https://streamja.com/4NkG) then to nine for a [second yellow to Gaëtan Paquiez](https://streamja.com/o4Ml), Nîmes opened the gates and Depay &amp; friends profited from it before their crucial match against RB Leipzig next tuesday.
* Paris did everything they could to lose in Montpellier but alas that was not enough. All the signs were positive with two injuries within the first 20 minutes, zero shot on target in the first half, an overall lethargic performance from the whole team, especially the front three, and an own goal from Paredes with his hand just before half-time. Unfortunately, that strategy didn't pay off as they were betrayed by their opponents, Pedro Mendes receiving a second yellow card for a tackle on Neymar. 7 minutes later, Paris was up 3-1. After that, Montpellier supporters, having probably seen what happened in Nîmes the day before, decided to one-up their neighbours by [throwing a bottle on Navas' head](https://streamja.com/9mMn).
* 7 minutes to score three goals, that's also what Monaco did against Amiens, whose situation is starting to become concerning. Like their parisians counterparts, they produced an uninspired first half but Ben Yedder, Maripán and Keita Baldé earned the principality club their second victory in a row.
* Guess what Toulouse did ? Yes.
* Saint-Étienne didn't confirm their last victory and stumbled against Reims 3-1 after Claude Puel decided to rotate heavily the squad. Reims re-enters the top 10 thanks to this win, the first after a 4-match sequence without one (1 loss and 3 draws).
* In the big match of the weekend, one of the most classic matches of the league, Marseille defeated Bordeaux 3-1 after being down 0-1 at half-time, earning their sixth win in a row and cimenting their status as the best team outside PSG, six points ahead of Lille.
* 35 goals were scored this weekend in Ligue 1. Sup, Bundesliga ?

&amp;#x200B;

### [](#icon-up-big) Upwards

* **[](#sprite1-p320) Renato Sanches :** It took him some time but Renato Sanches is starting to settle in Lille. And settling well recently. After two tough experiences in Munich and Swansea, the Euro 2016 Young Player of the Tournament may have found an environment suited for him with an ambitious-but-not-top club filled with portuguese players and staff that made a gamble with him (most expensive player in the history of the club). He was credited with an 8/10 in L'Équipe for his match against Brest following other strong performances in Ligue 1. He couldn't do much for Lille in Champions League unfortunately but overall, the signs are very positive.

* **[](#sprite1-p119) Jordan Amavi &amp; Dimitri Payet :** No players symbolize more the resurrection of OM than those two. As they both reached the rockbottom of their respective careers last year, they were regularly blamed by the supporters for being, along Rudi Garcia, the main culprits of the poor Marseille season. With the arrival of André Villas-Boas at the club however, they seem to have rejuvenated and got their level back. Payet has been decisive in four of the last five matches with 3 goals and 3 assists within this period while Amavi, who last year was regularly put on the bench to play Hiroki Sakai, a right-back, in his spot, has recovered his offensive and defensive qualities that most people were aware of when he played for Nice. Amavi even scored yesterday his first league goal in more than four years (L1 and Premier League combined). On top of that, in a press conference, Amavi said he has ""never seen Payet defend that much before"".

&amp;#x200B;

### [](#icon-down-big) Downwards

* **[](#sprite5-p347) Nîmes Olympique :** We already talked about Nîmes' situation in a [previous Bilan](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/dutetw/le_bilan_ligue_1_matchday_13_rudi_bad_trip/) but when a team concedes ten goals in three days, it's time to make an update. First of all, Nîmes din't win any of their last 10 games (4 draws and 6 losses, the last two being a 6-0 in Bordeaux and a 4-0 at home against Lyon). But what's more worrying for Nîmes is the state of nervousness that seems to hit every level of the club. On the pitch, the two early red cards spoken about previously. Those were followed by a scuffle in the stands where Nîmes supporters [started to go after Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas](https://twitter.com/ColinDelprat/status/1203049982946885632) that they deemed responsible for the refereeing decisions. Finally, the sporting director Laurent Boissier was fired after the loss. Boissier was at the club since 2015 and left in July due to conflicts with the president Rani Assaf before coming back in August. Yes, it's a mess.

* **[](#sprite2-p459) [](#sprite4-p31) [](#sprite1-p429) [](#sprite2-p108) [](#sprite5-p347) The bottom five :** Of course, it's a bit early to make definitive conclusions. After all, there are still 21 L1 matchdays to be played. However, as thigs stand now, the relegation battle looks set with five teams in the pit : Dijon, Amiens, Metz, Nîmes and Toulouse, given the five-point gap between Dijon (16th) and Strasbourg (15th). And the recent respective series of those clubs tend to prove it. In the last five matches played by each (so 25 matches overall), the results are as follows : 2 wins, 5 draws and 18 losses ; 11/75 points taken. And while things look certainly gloomer for Nîmes and Toulouse, one doesn't much to get out of the red zone, or to enter it.

### [](#icon-discuss-big) Quotes

Gautier Larsonneur, Brest goalkeeper :
&gt;Paul Bernardoni, one of my friends, told me: ""You'll get out of matches frustrated because you've made a lot of stops and it won't have much use for anything. Thank you Paulo for letting me know.

Andy Delort, Montpellier striker, about Neymar :
&gt;He's a great player, it's a shame he makes fun of everyone in the end, that's what I told him: ""In the end, you win 3-1..."" He was doing 63 one-two, he doesn't need that. That's a pity. He answered me, he told me he was passing the ball. That's not respect, but we must not have the same education. He's a little nervous, a little haughty with everyone. I told him to respect people. When everyone worships you, you have to show respect, good education... His attitude is no longer to be demonstrated since he has been in France, it is a game of folklore, he exaggerates a lot. He mocked us, he spoke badly, as usual.

Luka Elsner, Amiens coach :
&gt;The Monegasque corner was badly shot. That's the worst they've hit. Under these conditions, everything must be put in opposition and we have to sacrifice so that the opponent cannot strike. We didn't sacrifice ourselves. It's unbearable. Before the goal, we made sixty minutes of effort where Monaco had no opportunity. After the first goal conceded, we can take ten. We lose trust and nosedive. When you play for your survival, you have to have a reaction. I have a feeling of anger about this. It's not bad luck. Some things had been changed. We're going to change our approach. It is as much my responsibility as that of the players.

Baptiste Reynet, Toulouse goalkeeper :
&gt;I'm ashamed to lose again. That's the seventh time in a row! We have to realize that we are playing with our careers, there are people behind us, employees. We're in deep shit. I have no other word, we're gonna have to get off our asses because we're going straight there (to L2).

/u/Sneazzy, PSG supporter, /r/soccer exommunicate and Tours tram ambassador
&gt; Imagine Garcia's CM, the guy must open the account every 2 months and when he has the courage he scrolls through all the notifications to clean everything and refuse to touch it for another 2 months.

29,After almost 2 years of working as a freelance graphic designer with @TeamMessi its finally time to say goodbye. But I would like to clear some misconceptions about @TeamMessi.,"After almost 2 years of working as a freelance graphic designer with @TeamMessi its finally time to say goodbye. I've decided to shift my entire focus on my full-time job, and for this, I believe its time to move on...


But I would like to clear some misconceptions about @TeamMessi. People believe that @TeamMessi are perhaps pretty weak when it comes to managing Messi's PR and they should do much more. I would like to bring in a perspective as to how things work there...But of course, since Adidas is directly endorsed by Messi, they do the PR bit too. But the problem here is, Messi himself and his managers/agents have direct control on the PR activity that @TeamMessi carries on. Messi playing the bigger part of course. Trust me, I myself was asked to make 4 graphics a day that would help promote Messi as a player and not Adidas as a brand. And @TeamMessi has not just 1, but several graphic designers working for them.


But Messi and his team had a cap limit on the amount of promotion done...By talking to many of my colleagues there, I came to know that Messi really (and I emphasize on REALLY), is a humble man. He never prefers taking some help from a PR team to boost his stature... and him and his team are very strict about this. The only times when a graphic used to go live was on a major event or on or before a product launch. (You can see this for yourself). You won't see it at any other point of time and that's Messi's sole decision. Adidas has nothing to do with it. In fact, posting more graphics would actually help Adidas promote their brand. It hardly brings a cost to them. So why wouldn't they? Well, because Messi is way too humble for this.


The few posts that are made are just because of the contract that he needs to fulfill. Trust me, I have had tons of graphics down the trash, and it gets frustrating at times. But well.. it is what it is.


There was a word amongst the people who work there. They used to say that Messi preferred his performance do the talking because the world is the witness...He is of the opinion that PR is for the weak and that it just falsifies what a player does or doesn't do on the pitch.


So we can't really blame @TeamMessi here.


But these 2 years have definitely made me appreciate Messi a little more.

30,"Future of football 2020-2025 Period, My prediction !","  

**Future of Football predictions Part I Domestic League:** 

Hello everyone, a new decade is quickly coming giving us the opportunity to celebrate with our beloved but also to watch recaps of the 2010’s best football moments. As a passionate of football I’ve always loved to predict the incoming season, today I will push the limits further, here are my take for the next 5 years. I will come back in 2024 to see how bad my predictions were. Please don’t hesitate to comment on your own takes for the 2020-2025 period. I think it will be really fun to come back in five years to see how football had evolved

I will do another part for UCL and Players if you are interested.

I WILL COME BACK IN 5 YEARS TO SEE HOW INACCURATE MY PREDICTIONS WERE! THIS IS PURELY FICTIONAL I’M NOT AN EXPERT.

**Ligue 1** : 

As a French, Ligue 1 bears a lot of interests for me, today, globally “La Ligue 1” is facing severe difficulties as no teams other than PSG manages to install themselves into the top of the league (Top 3) with coherency playstyles and stability. Thus these teams hardly keep their talents, for some, it is owing to pure lucrative strategy: LOSC, but it’s mainly due to financial difficulties that force the French team to sell first to be able to buy players. 

My prediction: I think that L1 will start to be more stable, and some clubs will confirm their status and be more regular (OL, OM, OGCN). I believe that during the 5 next years PSG will assert its dominance on French national league, however, I’m predicting OM and OL to find more stability by qualifying and performing more frequently in UCL, and thus to be able to fight more intensely for the title from 2022-2023. As Monaco’s future is trouble for me as the team seems instable and the initial strategy was purely to make profits but I still believe they could outdo themselves for one season to fight for the title, in contrast, I believe that the team will fail to qualify for two consecutive UCL seasons and them will lose all their great players and will start to struggle a lot and fight to avoid the relegation. It is also quite the same with the LOSC if they manage to keep Campos as their recruiter, he’s doing an excellent job and thus will help the club to develop pure talent before selling them, I link their future to the future of Campos, if he leaves and the club keeps the “buying/selling strategy” they could face serious troubles. Nice will also have its word to say in the UCL fight from the start of next season with INEOS as their new owner that will surely be generous in the transfer market. Concerning the teams that will face difficulties I predict Toulouse (not risky at all) to be relegated within 2 years, I hardly see ASSE performs well, the team is aging, currently, none of their players can hope to play for a better club than ASSE I think that the club will pay its lack of ambitions.

In terms of players, I think that Cherki will quickly go to the summit, he is promising and will surely be sold for more than 80 million to a Spanish giant. Caqueret (OL) is also a great player and will surely be transferred to whether an English top club or an Italian top club.

Final ranking: 

2019-20: PSG, OM, OL / POTY: Mbappé

2020-21: PSG, OL, OM / POTY: Mbappé

2021-22: PSG, OGCN, OL / POTY : Cyprien (OGCN)

2022-23: PSG, OL, OM / POTY : Cherki (OL)

2023-24: OL, PSG, OGCN / POTY : Cherki (OL)

2024-25: PSG, OM, OL / POTY : Vinicius Junior (PSG)

**Premier League:**

Today IMO the PL is divided into groups: the 2 giants: LFC, MC, the 4 others: MU, CFC, Spurs, Arsenal,

The promising teams: Leicester, Wolves… Everton, and then the others.

I think that Liverpool will start facing trouble after its 2020 league title, maybe due to crucial players departures (Firmino, Mané…) and thus will let space for others. I think that Spurs can play for the 1st place from 2020-21, the squad is quite mature and will have an opportunity with Mourinho as a leader. CFC also has, according to me, promising future with their academy and thus I believe that they will at least win one BPL in the five next years. Concerning Man U I think their redemption will be slow but that they will be one of the 2 favorites for the title for the 2023-2025 seasons.

MC will maintain at the top, but will surely face difficulty (maybe 4th or 5th place) for 1 or 2 seasons when Guardiola will leave

I also think that Leicester will be quite stable at the top of the league but will fail to win a single PL.

In contrast, I hardly see Arsenal find a second breath, I believe the club will fail to qualify for UCL for at least 3 years in a row. They will surely try to engage Henry as their manager and it will end poorly.

In terms of player I believe that many Spurs players will outperform their real level in 2020, Ndombele will realize a tremendous season but will fail to confirm (still will do great). Bernardo Silva will continue to be amazing.

Gabi Jesus will become a great striker with another coach.

Joker: the team that recruits Allegri will surely directly fight for the title (maybe MU).

Final ranking: 

2019-20: LFC, MC, Leicester / POTY: Mané

2020-21: Spurs, MC, Liverpool / POTY: Ndombelé

2021-22: MC, Leicester, CFC / POTY : Bernardo Silva

2022-23: CFC, MU, Liverpool / POTY : Abraham

2023-24: MU, CFC, MC / POTY : Abraham

2024-25: MC, MU, Liverpool / POTY : Sterling

**Spain** : 

Not my domain, I barely watch La Liga so this is even more fictional.

I believe that the Barca/ Real /Atletico domination will continue with few changes :

FCB: Messi will offer the last title before leaving but Barca will struggle then. Real: Will soon get one of the deadliest strike force in the 2000’s football history (Rodrigo, Hazard, Mbappé ??, ), the team will develop and will win at least 2 titles.

ATM: When Simeone will leave the team will perform great for 1 season and then collapse

2019-20: FCB, REAL, ATM / POTY: Messi

2020-21: Real, FCB, Valence / POTY: Messi

2021-22: FCB, Real, ATM / POTY : Rodrigo

2022-23:  ATM, Real, Sevilla / POTY : J.Felix

2023-24: Real, Sevilla, Barca / POTY : Mbappé (Real)

2024-25: Barca, Real, Sevilla / POTY : De Jong

**Serie A**: Same here, I don’t watch the Italian league often, 

I think that Conte will, like in every other club where he managed to win a title, will collapse one or two seasons after the title. Conte will be sack mid-season after their title. I think Juve will also face difficulty due to poor choices, poor transfert decisions and poor finances that will force the club to sell their talents. I believe that Lazio and AS Roma will soon be key players when looking at the top 3, AC Milan will keep struggling and reconstruct slowly, maybe a top 3 place for them in 2024-25. 

2019-20: Juve, Inter, Lazio / POTY: Immobile

2020-21: Inter, Juve, Atlanta / POTY: Sensi

2021-22: Juve, As Roma, Lazio / POTY: Dybala

2022-23: As Roma, Juve, Lazio / POTY: Under

2023-24: As Roma, Lazio, Inter / POTY: ¿

2024-25: Inter, Lazio, AS Roma / POTY: ¿

**Bundesliga** : Not at all my domain, I believe that Bayern will still be dominant in Germany due to the prestige and their ability to attract every talented player of the league, plus they started to put some real money into transfers ( CF: Hernandez). Not many changes IMO. I think Leipzig will be able to take at least 1 bundes, I love the club and think that its potential is great.

2019-20: FCB, Borussia M, BVB / POTY: Lewa

2020-21: FCB, Leipzig, BVB / POTY: Lewa

2021-22: Lepzig, FCB, S04 / POTY: Sabitzer

2022-23: FCB, Leipzig, B Mgb / POTY: Havert (Bayern)

**Ones to Watch** : 

**Mbappé** : Surely one of the most talented prospects for the future, I think he will stay at PSG to try to win UCL with Paris, he will leave in 2021 for 250millions to Real after the UCL win for Paris the 30 May 2021. He will play at ST and will perform great during his merengue’s years, however, I don’t believe he will be close to Ronaldo’s stats at Madrid. After 3 seasons at Madrid : 96 matches 71goals, 13 assists

**Havertz** : Will join Bayern in a close future and will contribute to the dominance of Bayern but will struggle to perform well in a big fixtures such as UCL night.

**Ronaldo** : I believe that he will still play at least 3 seasons, he will retire in 2022-2023, at the end of the season, after ruining the Juve's financial statements with his huge salary, however, he will still perform greatly, maintaining good stats (minimum 12 goals per year in Serie A, + Important goals in big fixtures).

**Messi** : Even as a fan of Ronaldo I need to admit that Messi is more crucial to his club, he will play at least 3 seasons also, my take is that he will outpace Ronaldo in the UCL top scorers table.

**Vinicius** : He will suffer the comparison with Rodrigo that will appear more involved, less injury-prone, and more efficient. As a result he will leave for Paris to replace Neymar where he will thrive and became the POTY in 2024

**Halland** : I think that he will quickly join Leipzig, will develop quickly and will reach his full potential at 22-23, thus he will be a great striker but not the best. After two seasons at Leipzig, he will join Chelsea for 110 million to form a deadly duo with Abraham, will be the kind of striker that score 15-20 goals per season but will also produce some disappointing performances #Lukaku

**Benzema** : Will join back Lyon after a great 2020-2021 season at Madrid, he will form a crazy duo with Cherki Old/new gen.

**Sancho** : Will produce amazing pieces of skills as per today, will have a capacity to accelerate the came at any point, join MU in 2020 but will need few seasons to adapt before to fulfill its tremendous potential. Deadly Trio with Rashford and Martial.

**Luis Alberto** : Will join a Spanish club/ man city and will perform amazingly

**J. Felix** : Will struggle to develop its full potential due to severe injuries but will still be brilliant and lead ATM to their only Liga titles during this period

Please give your takes for this period, Thanks a lot for your time and attention!

I will surely do a second part UCL, Word cup and Ballon d'Or :)",soccer,1575918880,Matt7892,19,1,True,2019-12-09

He told me how he played against Leon Bailey when he was 15 and Leon was playing at that level in Jamaica. Leon's dad I guess was real intense because he never made it himself. Just so happened I was playing football manager while this all happened.

Pick a set of scores for the final matchday of a group. (Team towards top left corner is the home team)

Where they intersect should have a coloured square

Look up this colour in the key, and it will give you the final group positions if those scores were to happen.

Today I watch the final of the SEA cup Vietnam - Indonesia.

It's the first time I watch a game from an Asian cup, and I was quite surprised  with what I saw.


So many very borderline tackle, a lot of voluntary nodge, also a guy from Vietnam (that was winning) that just push the keeper that was holding the Bal in the hand for 2 second already. 

None of the above even granted a yellow card. 

I am sure in Europe standard the game would have ended with at least 3 red cards 

To the people watching sea games, is it always like this? Are the referee more laxiste?

291,[OC] Colombia's (In)famous World Cup Appearances,"**Had this in store as well so might as well share it! Really short but that doesn't have to be a bad thing... Right...**

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to 1994, Colombia’s World Cup history was very forgetable. They were knocked out in the group stage in 1962 and eliminated in the round of 16 in 1990. However ahead of the 1994 World Cup things seemed different. Colombia had finished third at the 1993 Copa America and fourth in 1991. On top of this, they also excelled in qualification. Winning their group and defeating Argentina two times in the process. One of which was a 5-0 demolition away. This Colombian team were serious contenders and many people had exceedingly high expecations of them. 

Colombia as a nation was in turmoil around this time. The war on drugs had only started a year earlier in 1993 and civil unrest was highly prevalent. The World Cup were one of few times were Colombia felt somewhat unified and could have something to celebrate. However, this sense of joy and optimism quickly dwindled when they lost 3-1 to Romania. With two games remaining, though, all hope was far from lost. Their next opponents were the hosts United States and despite Colombia losing to Romania, they were still the clear favorite. The United States obtained the lead in the 35th minute through a ridicilously unfortunate own goal by Andres Escobar. However, the consequences of that own goal would be far from ridicolous.

The game remained 1-0 until half time. But in the 52nd minute the United States doubled their lead and all hope was lost for Colombia despite them scoring a late consolation goal. Their 2-0 win against Switzerland in their last game was irrelevant. This World Cup was over for Colombia. Five days after Colombia had been eliminated, on july 1st, Escobar decided to call some of his friends and spend the night out in Medellin. They started by going to a bar. After staying there for a while they decided to leave and go to a liquor store. Shortly afterwards, they went to a nightclub where they eventually split up. Then at around 3 AM he was alone in a parking lot when three men appeared all of the sudden. An argument then ensued, which subsequently lead to Escobar being shot six times. On top of Escobar losing his life and his relatives losing a family member, it was a huge loss for the Colombian national team and Colombia as a nation. 

In the 1998 World Cup, Colombia was hoping to seek redemption from their past trials. However, they got nothing of it. Just like in 1994 they only obtained three points and were eliminated in the group stage. They had to wait 16 more years until 2014 until they finally made another appearance at the World Cup. In 2014 Colombia were still seeking redemption after what happened in 1994 and this time around, they would get it. They charmed the entire world with their exquisite and entertaining football, cruising through the group stage. Defeating Greece 3-0, the Ivory Coast 2-1 and Japan 4-1. In the round of 16 they were gonna face a Uruguay side that had defeated both Italy and England in the group stage. 

The last time Colombia faced Uruguay at a World Cup was in 1962, where Uruguay won 2-1. But this time around, it was Colombia’s and James Rodriguez’ turn to shine. In the 28th minute they took the lead through a strike by James Rodriguez that won the Puskas Award later in the year. A stunning volley from outside the penalty area. James scored yet again later in the game and Colombia won comfortably 2-0. However, their journey came to an end in the quarter-finals where they lost 2-0 to Brazil. Being eliminated in the quarter-finals would be considered a massive failure for some nations, but certainly not for Colombia. It was their best ever World Cup performance, where they experienced the success they should’ve experienced in 1994. They won the FIFA Fair Play Award and set the world on fire with some of the most entertaining football ever played.",soccer,1575987489,NationalTeamFootball,6,1,True,2019-12-10
301,"Juventus, Bayern and, above all, Manchester City have experienced a notable downturn compared to last year.

303,Presentation of UCL Football,"I love UCL football. The big 4 leagues all offer excellent entertainment but there is something special when the international element is introduced. In addition, the immediacy of knockouts raises the stakes and gets the cortisol pumping like no other.

Having said all that, the way the final matchday of the UCL group stages (and the R16 and QF for that matter) are presented leave a lot to be desired. The broadcasters should absolutely adopt the presentation model used in March Madness to present one of the best days of the entire football calendar.

What I'm suggesting is that each pair of group matches get played simultaneously with staggered starting times between groups. For example, the Group E matches could begin at 1:30pm, Group F matches at 2pm, Group G matches at 2:30pm, and Group H matches at 3pm (I'm using typical EST times). 

This is how the 64-team single elimination knockout college basketball tournament (aka March Madness) is broadcasted and it's one of the best spectator sporting events of the year. As one game winds to an end, the viewer instinctively checks the scoreboard and figures out which game to watch next--eyes remained glued to the tube. Is the early game a blowout/irrelevant? Start the next match from the beginning. Is a team from the earlier match mounting a comeback? Go back and watch the end! I don't know any football fan that wouldn't watch that straight through (time permitting). 

Instead, for example the typical US fan will have the opportunity to see 2-3 matches if they have a good subscription setup. I recognize that UCL broadcast rights in the US may be problematic, but to me this is something that UEFA should get ahead of and the broadcasters will follow.

Now I want to extend it so that, as you say, one day I can be a reference for everyone and my achievements can be a model for millions of children.""","**Real Madrid form and targets for this year**

&gt;I'm at a great time in physical, personal and professional terms. I have nothing to complain about. As for the team, it seems that they're getting their best version back and they're starting to walk the way we wanted them to. At the end we are all in a dynamic position where we work to create our best version and slowly find it through physical form and results. We'll try to prolong this to achieve the results we've set ourselves.

&gt;Targets for this season? You know very well that playing Real Madrid means aspiring and trying to fight all three games. Real is obliged to fight for them all. For today our situation is good, because we have a promotion in the Champions League and a point draw in the league with Barcelona. The goal for now is to finish the year well and win as many matches as possible. In addition, we are waiting for a classic, which will be very decisive.

**El Clasico**

&gt;Both teams are going through a good period and for football lovers there is nothing better than such a Clasico. This is the most desirable match on the world level for fans, but also for us. At the end you also want to win it when the second team is in good shape. Then it's even more valuable. Regardless of the disposition, this is a distinctive match and maybe it will not be decided yet, but it will be a great spectacle for fans. Let's hope we can hit the table and win there.

**Zidane**

&gt;Zidane has a big influence on the team? Yes, of course. Zizou is a great coach and a great expert in what Real Madrid means, a group or a locker room. We went through some glorious stages with him, so he knew exactly what the team needed. It was a very important, but also a courageous decision on his part to take up this role again, especially in this critical situation. For now we are doing well, although at the beginning it was hard for us to get into this dynamic or good rhythm. However, these problems were visible in all the great teams in Europe. We are glad that Zizou is leading this ship, because he knows us best and he can get the most out of us.

**Transfer from Sevilla to Madrid**

&gt;Changing Sevilla to Real Madrid? It's not easy. Coming to Real Madrid is such a big change in every way that until you do it, you have no idea what it looks like. I had the honour of taking this step. It was quite a critical moment, because I was young and had little experience. In Madrid, however, my family created such an environment for me that we lived in the capital, but it felt like I was still in Sevilla. In that sense the change was small, but the responsibility was different, because you represent the biggest club in the world. Every move you make has a global resonance. It's pride, but it's also responsibility, because you are a model for children. I have respect and gratitude for Sevilla, it remains in my soul, but when you go to Real, you realize that you are taking the most serious step you can take in football in your life.

**Legacy**

&gt;A place among the great Real characters? I feel proud of it. Nobody gave it to me. Behind these trophies and laurels there is work, dedication, commitment and maintaining a constant level in the shadows. It's not enough to get here, it's also necessary to stay here. Many people know this. Success is no coincidence. You can come and touch the sky once, but then you have to stay there. Staying in Real Madrid is really hard. I was very lucky to have come and stayed here, which for me is also a dream come true. Now I want to extend it so that, as you say, one day I can be a reference for everyone and my achievements can be a model for millions of children, so that they can see that when you work and fight, you can make your dreams come true. I don't know if I'm going to be a legend, but if I'm going to be a reference for someone, it's going to be a success and an achievement for me. Let's hope so.

**Best moment from CL runs**

&gt;A moment from the four Champions League trophies? There is one moment that has marked my story.... [laughter] I think this moment has also marked the history of Real Madrid in the Champions League. Then we stopped this period of drought without winning the European Cup. Surely the 93rd minute in Lisbon is the most representative moment of those years, but not only mine, but the whole of Madridismo. This moment also allowed us to return to winning in the following seasons, to win the trophy three times in a row.... It's not about the goal itself, it's about the circumstances. We were losing, added time.... It marked everything. In the end, however, with the Champions League is like with children, I love them all the same and I can't choose one.

**The secret to winning so many headers?**

&gt;Look, when you ask me about these things, I always remember the beach and playing with my father. We went into the water and he threw me the ball, and I was heading it in all possible ways. In the end it seems like a game, but it became my advantage. I'll always be grateful to my dad for having patented something like that without even knowing it [laughs]. If you add a little faith to that... When I go into a rival's penalty box, I always think I'll hit the ball. Of course you have to have this innate timing, but you still have to have it 

**Future replacement**

&gt;Who can replace me in Real Madrid? In Real life it is a difficult subject.... Even after the match in Lisbon it was said about me that I was just a new Hierro [laughter]. At the end such comparisons are never good. But we have a really good academy. When we give up someday, someone will surely appear, and there will always be options on the market, including foreign ones. However, I think Real should maintain a Spanish base. We cannot lose this identity.

**Upcoming young defenders and wanting to play as long as possible**

&gt;What kind of a young defender do I like now? De Ligt from Juve, has a great potential and a great future. Of course, he needs experience, but he can be a CB for the future. We will see. I think the problem is that we are retired in Spain at the age of 33-34 and can play in Italy up to the age of 38-40. There are also untouchables and saints there. I take great care of myself and I will play as long as my joy and hope of playing is intact. As long as I can enjoy this world and feel good, I will decide the end of my career, not some criticism or opinion. I think I can still play at the level I want to play for 3-4 years.

&gt;What about after my career? I don't plan anything that isn't related to football or sport. I have hobbies like business, music or horses, which I will devote more time to, which I lack now. In professional terms, however, I would like to remain involved in football, because I have the great knowledge about it and I could tell you the most about it. I do not rule out training or any other relationship with football.

**Being a coach**

&gt;How would my team play? I have always had a great admiration for Zizou or Ancelotti, whom I also have a lot of sympathy for. The coach is not only an expert in tactics or techniques. He also needs to know how to use the locker room and manage various situations. I would take parts from many trainers.... I also like Simeone very much.... Today the physical form and preparation are more and more balanced, so winning costs more and Cholo uses his resources to the maximum in this respect. I really like this ideology, which I would combine with talent and possession of the ball, because that's what I like. The more balls you have, the less danger your opponent poses. I can't tell you any more secrets [laughs].

**Ballon d'or**

&gt;Why don't the defenders win the Golden Ball? At the end of the game you do not have a single basis for winning the prize. A good defender has the same merit as a good attacker, but in the end football marketing lives off goals and it is especially the strikers who have the ability to attract these individual prizes. We lived now in the age of two greats, Leo and Cristiano, who took everything. When you give a Golden Ball to one of them, there's not much to blame for that choice, although someone next to you could probably deserve it. As a defender, what am I supposed to say...? I won so much, and I never even sat there or wasn't in a threesome. I don't worry about it too much, because football is a team sport, but such a prize must be something fun. A lot would have to happen for a defender to reach for the Golden Ball. It happened with Cannavaro and let's hope it happens again.... I think they could make a Golden Ball just for Messie and Cristiano and a second for the others [laughs]. That would be the best for football.

**Legacy**

&gt;How would I like to be remembered? It's hard to get into the heads of so many people... I have always respected everyone. Every criticism allowed me to work more and improve. I am also grateful for that. And I will be eternally grateful for the praise, because I always felt this support and it helped me. I hope to be remembered as a footballer who always tried to do his best, even when he wasn't doing his best. First of all, I want to be remembered as someone humble, honest and loyal, who has worked and done his job all his life, which in my case is football.

64,Explaining Flamengo fans' obsession with Liverpool,"In Brazil, winning the Club World Cup has always been the feat to achieve, perhaps the highest a club could aim for. Nowadays, that feeling is intensified by the fact that European clubs have reached a much higher level than those in South America, which has not always been the case historically, especially not in the 20th century. Greater difficulty to match the Champions League winners means greater satisfaction in the case of victory against them in a final.

For Europeans, on the other hand, the decline in quality of South American football since the last century played the countereffect: when things used to be more level, more was at stake in facing the Libertadores winners in the old *Intercontinental Cup*, there was more value in conquering that trophy. Since then, however, the Club World Cup is often taken for granted: having already won the Champions League, it cannot get any higher than that for a European club. Perhaps a great example of how different things were *back in the day* is the infamous final contested by [Celtic (European champions) and Racing (South American champions) in 1967](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1967_Intercontinental_Cup). The third match (played after two wins from each side) had a total of six players sent off, four from Celtic and two from Racing.

In 1981, Flamengo won its first ever Copa Libertadores. The team led by club legend Zico therefore went on to face 1980-81 European champions Liverpool, which had beaten Real Madrid to take its third European cup home. The game, played in Japan, marked history in every one of *Flamenguistas'* hearts as they saw their team beat the English side [3-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUVA-eIv0s0), with two goals from legendary center-forward Nunes and one from Adílio.

That win is referenced in one of the most popular songs chanted by Flamengo fans, *Em Dezembro de 81*. (In December '81) [Link to the song with lyrics in Portuguese/English]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8IgwDSE19A).

**Em Dezembro de 81**

Em Dezembro de 81 / In December '81

Botou os ingleses na roda / You ran in circles around the englishmen

3 a 0 no Liverpool / You beat Liverpool 3-0

Ficou marcado na história / It left a mark on history

E no Rio não tem outro igual / And in Rio de Janeiro there is no other like you

Só o Flamengo é campeão mundial / Only Flamengo are World Champions

E agora o seu povo / And now your people

Pede o mundo de novo / Asks for the world again

Da-lhe da-lhe da-lhe Mengo

Pra cima deles Flamengo / Go ahead Flamengo 

Unsurprinsingly, [the song made the rounds again in Lima, Peru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9EwsfbpQK4), where the *Carioca* side gloriously triumphed 2-1 over River Plate coming back from a 1-0 defeat which was the score up until the minute 89 to win the Copa Libertadores and paint South America with red and black, the club's colors, for the 2nd time. 

Having all that in mind, the fans certainly took some joy in the fact that Liverpool won the Champions League this year and started to look forward to the possibility that they may face each other again in this year's Club World Cup final. Even before reaching the Libertadores final, and winning the whole thing, Liverpool was already in the minds of each fan, probably since as early as the quarterfinals. Hopes are left to December, when they might (each still has to play the semifinal), and most likely will (given the huge disparity in quality between the two and the rest of the teams), clash again.",soccer,1575058659,DarkNightSeven,168,1,True,2019-11-29

139,"What a save! Please, God will condemn guilty sinners to Hell because He is Just, Please don’t die in your sins! God offers salvation as a gift through the Lord Jesus Christ, who is God come in flesh to suffer the wrath of God we deserved, died for our sins buried and rose again. Repent and believe!","                         GOOD NEWS.                  

Summary just Incase if you did not want to read it all. a message out of love. Before getting to the good news and bad news, lets cover a few things up. When we look around we see intelligent design, when we look at us we have objective morality (we know right and wrong) and a conscience, God has revealed Himself clearly to us through Creation and through His Word ""The Bible is a reliable collection of historical documents written by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses which report supernatural events in fulfillment of specific prophecies claiming that they are words of divine origin, rather than human in origin."" God is Holy and in His justice, and because we've sinned against God (ask yourself, have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything despite its value? Have you ever blasphemed the name of the Lord like saying OMG, have you ever looked with just which is committing adultery in the heart, have you ever hated someone?) He must condemn guilty sinners to Hell. But, God doesn’t want any to perish, but God is Just and can’t just forgive guilty sinners, so God in His love and mercy sent His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, which is God manifested in the flesh, God crushed and slaughtered Christ under the wrath of God and judgement we deserved, then Jesus suffered and died for His people’s sins, was buried and rose again offering salvation to all that repent (turn away from sins) and trust in what He has done. Understand that God is Holy, Just and Perfect and righteous, and we are sinners, who broke His Commandments, but that God provided the Savior. Romans 6:23 says, “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” believe in the Lord Jesus Christ we are saved by grace through faith in His blood.

Unfortunately we live in a corrupt society that intuitively knows God exists (through intelligent design, order, conscience, objective morality, sense of justice) but suppress the truth in unrighteousness, people tend to not like what goes against their pleasures unfortunately. Despite all the evidence (24,000 manuscripts, 9 ancient sources, 500+ eyewitnesses, historical scholars and professors know this to be true as well, above all the word of God) of the Lord Jesus Christ death burial and resurrection for the forgiveness of sins by repentance and faith, would you rather live a lifestyle of sin and be condemned or receive eternal life God offers as a gift by His amazing grace through the Lord Jesus Christ.

When we repent of our sins and trust fully in the Saviour to rescue us from our own sinfulness, we become new creations! “The old has gone, the new has come” (2 Corinthians 5:17)! Along with inheriting our new identity as a Christian, a child of God, an ambassador for the Lord, we are assured a place in Heaven and gain the desire and power to battle sin. Whereas before, we were held captive to sin, utterly powerless and given zero reason even to fight against it, now, we are slaves to Christ and His righteousness (Romans 6:18). This is where true freedom begins! But, what exactly does repentance mean? And what does it look like to trust Christ exclusively.

Repentance is to reject your old sinful ways of living and make a 180-turn towards God and His good, righteous character/statutes. It means we feel the weight of our guilt before God and respond by sincerely apologizing for our wickedness, thanking Him for His pardon through the blood of Jesus, and living the rest of our lives to please Him — and Him alone. Trusting alone in Christ knowing no amount of good deeds can save you, and following Him loving the Lord thy God being obedient, faithful and enduring till the end. There will be trials and tribulations, but it is for our benefit! Humble yourself. Quit being prideful, relying upon your own good deeds to get you through. Please, there is nothing more important than your eternal Salvation, this isn't some fairytale, it's rather True or it isn't. It’s rather Christ is Risen and we can be justified through faith in His blood, or not. We are not just a body of matter that exploded from nothing, please think about this.

This view [that Jesus didn’t exist] is demonstrably false. It is fuelled by a regrettable form of atheist prejudice, which holds all the main primary sources, and Christian people, in contempt. …. Most of its proponents are also extraordinarily incompetent.

Maurice Casey, Nottingham University, in Jesus of Nazareth

Today, nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically.

The late Graham Stanton, Cambridge University, in The Gospels and Jesus

Biblical scholars and classical historians now regard it [the theory that Jesus didn’t exist] as effectively refuted.

Robert Van Voorst, Western Theological Seminary, in Jesus outside the New Testament

I do not have to provide you evidence because you know God exists but suppress the truth in unrighteousness, it is not a truth problem, it’s a heart problem, people don’t want there to be a God because there love for sin and pleasures are more than being righteous.

Well, people tend to not like what goes against there pleasures unfortunately, a main reason why people suppress the existence of God, nothing can not create space matter nor time, and also they believe there is no such thing as good or evil nor objective truth, our conscience says otherwise. 

The Bible is a reliable collection of historical documents written by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses which report supernatural events in fulfillment of specific prophecies claiming that they are words of divine origin, rather than human in origin.""    derived from 2 Peter 1:16-21

C.S. Lewis on Reasoning to Atheism

‎”Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It’s like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can’t trust my own thinking, of course I can’t trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.”

—C.S. Lewis
The Case for Christianity, p. 32.

162,Scout Report [2019-11-30],"Welcome to your thread dedicated to scouting some slightly less well known players. Whether it’s a young
prospect at your club that you want to bring to other’s attention or an older head from a team most won’t
normally watch that you think is the next Jamie Vardy.

For those of you that are unsure how to approach it, here’s a guideline of stuff that you may want to include
(feel free to add or change according to how you see fit though):

**Games watched** - Just a little description of what they’re basing their judgment on Basic info of the player -
age, nationality, height etc.

**Stats** - Games played, goals, whatever and source for things that aren’t basic
like some of the stuff whoscored.com provides. Description of current role within team. What are his
primary responsibilities? What does he allow other players to do?

**Strengths/weaknesses**

**Summary** - Can be where he’s at now, his potential, any discussion about tactical fits etc. If some sort of
grade is included, give a key every time, because it won’t mean the same thing to everybody

This thread is really for players that not everyone will be familiar with, so please try and encourage those
giving insight to players you’ve not heard of before.

169,Manchester United’s trophy cabinet compared to every club in professional sports,"Manchester United have won 66 trophies in their illustrious footballing history - 20 league titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups, 21 domestic super cups, 3 European Cups, 1 Cup Winners Cup, 1 Super Cup, 1 Intercontinental Cup and 1 FIFA Club World Cup. Everyone knows this makes the club one of the most decorated in Europe, but what about if you compared our success to that of clubs all over the world, and not just in football but in all of professional team sports? With the help of stats compiled by u/SportsFan591 (and with his blessing to use them), you can see the following:

**FOOTBALL -** [https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/30-most-successful-football-clubs-19428893](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/30-most-successful-football-clubs-19428893)

* Recently published stats on the most decorated football clubs in the world seem to have taken our 66 trophies and added to them our 5 Manchester Cups won in the 1800s while it was still a first-team competition before the club turned professional. However, as these were not professional victories and the club themselves dont recognise them amongst our honours haul ([https://www.manutd.com/en/history/trophy-room](https://www.manutd.com/en/history/trophy-room)), I believe it'd be fair to remove them and thus United would go from the 12th to the **14th** most decorated club in the world. Still though, a comfortable top-15 place!

**BASKETBALL -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/dvdds0/basketball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/dvdds0/basketball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* Manchester United's trophy haul would place us within the top 5 on the list of the most decorated basketball clubs ever. Our haul of 66 trophies would see us come **5th.**

**AMERICAN FOOTBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* Manchester United would comfortably finish **1st** in a trophy table amongst American football clubs, our haul exactly trebling that of the most successful NFL side, the Green Bay Packers!

**CRICKET** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic\_cricket\_clubs\_with\_the\_most\_trophies\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic_cricket_clubs_with_the_most_trophies_in/)

* United would come **1st** on a list of the most decorated cricket clubs, seven trophies ahead of the most decorated side in the sport's history, Australia's New South Wales team.

**HOCKEY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would finish **3rd** on a list of the most decorated hockey teams, a full 24 trophies ahead of fourth-placed Acroni Jesenice of Slovenia and only five and seven trophies off the sport's most decorated duo, CSKA Moscow of Russia and Steaua Rangers of Romania.

**RUGBY UNION** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby\_union\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby_union_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United would finish **2nd** amongst all rugby union clubs, several trophies ahead of third-placed Celik, 23 trophies ahead of fourth-placed Steaua Bucuresti and only seven trophies off the most decorated team in the sport, Croatia's Nada Split.

**RUGBY LEAGUE** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby\_league\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby_league_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United would also place **2nd** when their success is measured against all rugby league clubs, just edging out Leeds Rhinos and St. Helens but well off the pace from Wigan Warriors, by far the most dominant team in the sport and arguably the most dominant team within one sport in the entire sporting world.

**BASEBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United finish **2nd** in comparison to all baseball clubs, almost ten trophies ahead of third-placed Yomiuri Giants of Japan, 28 trophies ahead of fifth-placed Draci Brno of the Czech Republic and only ONE trophy off the pace from the sport's most successful side, the New York Yankees.

**HANDBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* Man United would finish **4th** on a list of the most decorated handball clubs in history, one trophy ahead of RK Zagreb and seven trophies off third-place Esperance de Tunis.

**VOLLEYBALL -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/volleyball/comments/dumot6/volleyball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/volleyball/comments/dumot6/volleyball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United's trophy haul would place us **4th** on a list of the most successful volleyball clubs too, and just five trophies off the top 2!

**AUSSIE RULES** \-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian\_football\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian_football_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would comfortably finish **1st** amongst the most decorated Aussie Rules sides, seven trophies ahead of Port Adelaide, 18 trophies ahead of Norwood and 27 trophies ahead of fourth-placed East Fremantle.

**BANDY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would likewise easily finish **1st** on a list of the most decorated bandy clubs, a full 14 trophies ahead of the most decorated team in the sport, Dynamo Moscow, and 32 trophies ahead of the next most successful club, Vasteras.

**PESAPALLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United finish **1st** ahead of every Pesapallo club in terms of success, having won almost four times as many trophies as the most successful club in the sport, Sotkamon Jymy.

**WATER POLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water\_polo\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/waterpolo/comments/cyuof1/water_polo_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

227,Is it time to reverse the 3pm blackout?,"Despite being the most popular sport in the British Isles, football matches are barred from being broadcast between 2.45 and 5.15 on a Saturday, which coincidentally, is when most matches are played.

In the 1960s, Burnley chairman Bob Lord argues that it would have a negative impact on match attendances and it would force supporters to attend matches in person and therefore increase gate receipts for clubs.

This van doesn’t apply outside of the U.K, so a Manchester United fan in Texas can watch more games on television than a Manchester United fan in Manchester.

Do you think given the fact football and the EPL in particular is one of the most popular leagues and sports in the world is still relevant? 

In the 2016/17 season, 11 of the 20 premier league clubs would have still made a profit even if they hadn’t played a single game in front of a crowd. Commercial deals, including TV rights, make up a significant amount of club income and the EPL commands one of the highest rights deals in sport.

So as teams become increasingly less reliant on match day attendances (and I would suspect a large proportion of fans would still want to match the feeling of watching a game live regardless whether or not it is broadcast) — Would it have a positive or negative impact on the game in the U.K to reverse the blackout?",soccer,1575121944,bvllamy,173,1,True,2019-11-30

357,This weekend’s best goals in German football (so far),"I decided to compile the best goals that happened in German football this weekend so far in one post. If any of these goals had happened in the premier league, they would’ve been gilded and upvoted a lot and I just thought that it would be nice to compile those best goals for you to see in one spot. So here you go, this is what happened in German football since Friday afternoon: 

First, a goal from the Bundesliga: 

[Sabitzer vs Paderborn](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e3xh08/sc_paderborn_02_rb_leipzig_m_sabitzer_4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Next up: two goals from German third division: 

[Kaiserslautern’s Skarkatidis vs Viktoria Köln](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e3xp2v/viktoria_k%C3%B6ln_24_1fc_kaiserslautern/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

and 

[Halle’s Terrence Boyd vs Duisburg](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e3xsks/hallescher_fc_10_msv_duisburg_terrence_boyd_88/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Back to Bundesliga again: 

[Raman vs Union Berlin](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e3jv3b/schalke_10_union_berlin_benito_raman_23/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

and last but not least, here are two from Bundesliga 2:

[Osnabrück’s Niklas Schmidt vs Hamburg](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e3icc3/osnabruck_10_hamburg_niklas_schmidt_37/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

and 

[Karlsruhe’s Philipp Hofmann vs Regensburg](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e3iuw1/karlsruhe_30_regensburg_philipp_hofmann_bicycle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

I hope you enjoy these. If so, let me know, then I’ll make a second compilation for the second part of the match day!",soccer,1575132007,TheCatInTheHatThings,6,12,True,2019-11-30

239,Final Euro 2020 seeding + Playoff situation,"The final seeding has been finally finished. It has been determined by ranking every qualified nation’s overall performance in the qualification phase. Italy is number 1, then Belgium, then England and so on. The complete seeding situation currently looks like this after ranking every qualified nation:

**Pot 1** | **Pot 2** | **Pot 3** | **Pot 4** 
---------|----------|----------|----------
Belgium | France | Portugal | Wales |
Italy | Poland | Denmark | Finland |
England | Switzerland | Turkey | League A Play-off winner |
Germany | Croatia | Austria | League B Play-off winner |	
Ukraine | Netherlands | Sweden | League C Play-off winner |	
Spain | Russia | Czech Republic | League D Play-off winner |

___________________________________________________________________

Ukraine will be allocated to Group C automatically, because groups ADEF will be occupied by host nations. The issue is further complicated by Ukraine being barred from Russia’s group, which leaves only the Netherlands group available for them. That means that Belgium goes to Group B automatically. The final draw situation currently looks like this: 


Group A | Group B | Group C
---------|----------|----------
Italy | Belgium | Ukraine 
X | Russia | Netherlands
X | Denmark  | X
Finland/Wales | Finland/Wales | A/C/D winner

Group D| Group E | Group F
---------|----------|----------
England | Spain | Germany
X | X | X
X | X | X
A/C/D winner | B winner | A/C/D winner

Italy, Netherlands, England, Spain and Germany all guaranteed to play three matches at home, as host partner did not qualify directly

___________________________________________________________________________

League C and League A empty spots will be filled a draw that will determine where Romania, Hungary, Israel and Hungary will go. Current Nations League Playoffs:

League A | League B | League C | League D
---------|----------|----------|----------
Iceland | Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina | Scotland | Georgia
Romania/Hungary | Slovakia | Norway | North Macedonia
Bulgaria/Israel | Republic of Ireland | Serbia | Kosovo
Israel/Hungary | Northern Ireland | Bulgaria/Israel/Romania/Hungary | Belarus

The matches for League B and D are completely set now, with C looking almost done too unlike the mess in League A. The playoff semifinals will be played on the 26 of March and the finals on the 31st.

267,Who should Tottenham hire as their manager? (OC),"Poch has left Tottenham. The Argentine is one of their best managers ever, but results this year have been terrible. Spurs have a top 4 quality squad, so needless to say, they need to get this appointment right or risk regressing to their previous place in the football hierarchy. With that in mind, I've prepared my list of who Tottenham should go for logically if they want to progress. Here are their options right now


1. Any of their back room staff, likely Ryan Mason

The Spurs hierarchy may believe that the key to regaining form is to simply cut the head off, and that they can come up with a new pick next year. This would be more long term friendly, as it allows some managers of quality the ability to become available (and allows some managers sacked after the Euros, perhaps Low or Southgate, to be considered for the job.) This would not be popular with the Spurs fans. Sacking Poch likely won't be eiether, but this will likely incense a good number of fans as it seems like the club hadn't prepared for his departure. This seems unlikely because sacking Poch at this point in the international break makes it seem as if they have found a replacement. 

Rating: 4/10
Spurs need a decisive move right now or they risk undoing a good deal of progress.

Jose Mourinho.

Mournho would not be a popular pick. He managed one of Tottenham's greatest rivals, and he is not known as a builder of teams. He is, however, a serial winner. Mourinho needs plenty of cash to win matches, but he gets results. His United tenure aside, the man is one of the best managers in world football. Wether or not he aligns with Tottenham's philosophy is another thing.

5/10
Pick a builder, someone who can rebuild the team after the clearout next summer. Moruinho would be a direct opposite of what Poch represented.

Massimiliano Allegri.

The former Juve manager is a highly successful coach who has won things all over Italy, but he comes with limitations. Allegri garnered a reputation as a defensive coach in Turin, something that ultimately resulted in the club and him parting ways, as well as his failure to procure a champions league trophy. Tottenham would, similar to Mourinho, be sacrificing the idea that they play attacking football, but Allegri may be willing to manage with less funds than Jose.

6/10
Allegri may be a good option, but it remains to be seen if he could adjust to England quickly or not.

Eddie Howe.

Howe has overachieved with Bournemouth for a number of years, and is a builder of squads, although his transfer acumen leaves something to be desired. Tottenham would likely not have Howe be in charge of transfers, as Poch didn't have such a role eiether, and yet their are still questions. Howe didn't struggle nessecarily when he left the Cherries for Burnley years ago, but he was unhappy there when compared to the club he loves. Howe deserves a shot at a top job, but does he even want one? Tottenham, unlike the rest of the top 6, are willing to take a chance on a manager in the Preimer League, as Poch was one of these as well. But if Howe could adjust to White Hart Lane remains to be seen.

Rating: 7/10

Laurent Blanc

The man who has been linked with every top job ever open since leaving Paris Saint-Germain has yet to take another job in the years since, but he may get an opportunity in Tottenham. The club have since adopted a style of attacking football, something Blanc is known to play. Blanc, like Pochettino, is also know for his abilites to motivate, something he did very well in his three managerial jobs. Blanc would be a good appointment, but would he be able to jump back into football after a three year absence?

8/10

Alan Pardew

No.

0/10


Marcelino.

After his unjust sacking from Valencia, Marcelino has been mentioned for many top jobs in Europe. The manager is a winner, his Valencia teams overachieved to reach the champions league, and he is also good at steadying the ship during a bad run of form, as evidenced by his performance during Valencia's poor run last year which ended in a Cup win and Champions League qualification. He is not an attacking manager, his sides are very good defensively, but he does not play an exciting style. May be a name to watch for.

Afaik, Nations League divisions were based on each team’s FIFA ranking, so doesn’t give mediocre teams incentive do actually not do well in friendlies and qualifying to stay in lower divisions of the Nations League to make the Euro proper?

So you've made some bad choices in life and are part of an elaborate betting spectacle for the man. All players of all eras up to the present are available, and your life and fortune depend on these picks.

* One has to sink a pk against 2012 Petr Cech (and he did his research on whoever you pick, Big Pete has it in his sock)
* One has to sink a free kick over the wall against 2018 Liverpool
* One has to successfully take on Kante and and beat him

Hopefully people have some fun with this, definitely was interesting thinking about who I'd choose if my literal life depended on it. 

My picks : Lampard for PK and that's an instalock, Jamie Vardy for the duel, and...hear me out on this. 

David Luiz for the free kick. Odds are already against us so fucking YOLO, I wanna go out in style.

[](#icon-net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

1': We're off!

15': A fiercely fought opening fifteen minutes, but neither side really able to penetrate the defense yet, no shots fired.

17': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL BAYERN!! A period of unrelenting pressure finally pays off as Pavard finally puts the ball in the right spot and of course it's *Robert Lewandowski* who flies in to score the point-blank header!**](https://streamja.com/vB1N)

26': Bayern pouring on the pressure again and Coman gets off a shot but it sails over the bar.

27': Cleared off the line! Coman flicks it to the far corner but there's a defender in the way!

27': SAVE! Gnabry denied from distance! Somehow Dortmund survive a horrible spell of pressure!

36': [](#icon-sub) Dortmund substitution: *Raphaël Guerreiro* on for *Jadon Sancho*

38': Gnabry scores!!! Wait, no he doesn't, because he was offside.

43': Gnabry tries with his left foot but doesn't hit the target.

45': Guerreiro wastes a promising free kick on the side of the box, Witsel just barely gets to it but can't get it anywhere near the target.

**HT Bayern Munich 1-0 Borussia Dortmund** Bayern with the deserved lead at the half. Dortmund are still in it but they need to step it up.

-----

46': We're back!

47':  [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL BAYERN!! *Serge Gnabry* finishes off a beautiful counter-attacking sequence! But wait, it's been canceled by the flag again! The initial pass is judged to be offside but wait, was Muller in his own half? He was!! VAR overturns the flag and the goal will count!**](https://streamja.com/qvnV)

52': Almost a second for Gnabry! He gets on the end of a long Route 1 pass but pokes it wide of the goal.

59': Lewandowski fires just wide! Good move to get free of Hummels but he doesn't usually miss from that close.

61': [](#icon-sub) Dortmund double sub: *Paco Alcácer and Marco Reus* on for *Julian Weigl and Mario Götze*

67': [](#icon-yellow) *Kingsley Coman* called for a foul on Hakimi, he disagrees with the call by kicking the ball away, gets carded for dissent

69': Surely a goal for Dortmund! And yet no! Martínez deflects the cross! Alcácer's still there to get on the end of it but he hits it wide! That was the chance.

70': [](#icon-sub) Bayern substitution: *Philippe Coutinho* on for *Serge Gnabry*

72': [](#icon-sub) Bayern substitution: *Thiago Alcântara* on for *Leon Goretzka*

73': Coman puts his shot just over the bar! And just a short time later Müller gets a chance but he curls it far away from the goal.

75': [](#icon-sub) Bayern substitution: *Ivan Perišić* on for *Kingsley Coman*

76': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL BAYERN!! Müller sends a perfectly weighted pass over to *Robert Lewandowski* and of course he's not going to miss!**](https://streamja.com/p90R)

79': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL BAYERN!! It's a tragic own goal from *Mats Hummels*! He had to get there before Thiago but it did no good! They staved off the onslaught for a while but now it looks like this will be a massacre after all!**](https://streamja.com/MRaG)

88': Perišić with the volley! Across face of goal and wide.

90+1': [](#icon-yellow) *Joshua Kimmich* pushes down Guerreiro

**FT Bayern Munich 4-0 Borussia Dortmund** What crisis? Bayern once again dominates Dortmund at the Allianz.",soccer,1573327395,MisterBadIdea2,415,1,True,2019-11-09

198,Make VAR a challenge-based system where managers/captains ask the officials to look at a controversial decision - similar to tennis or American football,"I think a simple solution to VAR would be to implement a challenge based system which the manager/captain can choose to exercise if they think a wrong decision has been made.

Teams would get for example 3 challenges a game, and would ask the referee/fourth official or review what they think is an incorrect decision.

If the on field decision is overturned, then the team would get to keep their challenge; if it wasn’t overturned, they would lose a challenge. 

I think this would make encourage players and managers to consider when to make a challenge rather than bombard the officials and appealing for VAR. I think it would incur less controversy due to numerous incidents being overturned for minute details, and I think it would help the game flow more as there are less VAR delays, and if challenges are correct (ie, overturned), then it would justify the delays. 

I don’t watch American football but o seem to recall from playing madden a long tome ago there is a similar challenged based system , and I watch a lot of tennis and the Hawkeye system in tennis is tried and tested and very rarely causes controversy whilst being embraced by the players.

253,Observations From Today's Real Madrid Game: Midfield Analysis and Why I Think Donny Van De Beek Is Coming To Madrid.,"I had originally posted this on the Real Madrid subreddit but though it would be nice to share on here too. The post is written from the perspective of Madrid so you'll have to excuse that. 

TL;DR This post is very long and after writing all this I don't have the dedication to write a detailed TL;DR. but I essentially talked about how the team ends up playing a 4-2-3-1 and how Valverde is the instigator for this change. After this I talk about how Van De Beek would fit into the mold for this new Madrid.

Hey guys! I was watching the game today and noticed a really crucial thing. I think we can all agree that Valverde has been a shining star and his current role is something new that hasn't really been a part of Real Madrid before.

Most websites, apps and even people would say the we play a 4-3-3 after looking at the squad list but I think I would disagree with that. We were very obviously playing 4 at the back but the change happens when you play closer attention to the midfield. Casemiro was playing in his defensive role, aiding the CBs and fighting in the midfield.

However a change occurs when you look at the roles of Valverde and Modric. Like the apps and sites suggest you would think that they were playing as the 2 CM's in the 4-3-3 but this changes when you look at the actual shape. Instead of being a part of the midfield 3, we actually played in a 4-2-3-1.

Modric stayed alongside Casemiro to help in releasing pressure and distributing the ball which are Casemiro's weaknesses but Modric's strengths. I think even with his current age, there are hardly any players in the world that are as good as Modric in those scenarios and that was clear in today's game. He brings the ball out of the back and allowed the team to play through the extremely intense and high press of Madrid.

While often last season, when we were out of form, we would simply resort to hoofball and just smack the ball out of the defence, today we never did that and properly played out the press. Such a tactic would've been wonderful at the Ajax game and will continue to be useful as more and more teams adopt this high press game. This was the involvment of Modric to the team, now let's get to valverde.

Valverde is young and that mean he has energy, He is essentially the only midfielder on our team with the energy to press and he sure as hell does! Not a single one of Benz, Hazard, Kroos, Modric or Casemiro is an extremely dedicated presser and Valverde essentially does the job for all of them. 

He always tracks back and ensures that he is supporting the defence during counters(I can remember one specific instance today where he made a tackle right in front of our box and then also proceeded to make a sliding block to the follow up shot.) He is also a constant pain in the ass to the opponents in midfield(Always fighting with physicality, winning aerial duels and not hesitating to do tactical fouls if needed.) Finally he is also crucially involved in the attack(always charges upwards, combines with teammates, makes runs in behind and also makes late runs/stays open for cutback, which is how he scored today!)

These attributes mean that he is not really a regular part of the midfield and essentially ends ups playing as the advanced midfielder in the 4-2-3-1. While he is currently doing a fantastic job, it is clear to those watching the games that he still lacks the final little bit of quality to cement himself as a starter. I feel he is solid defensively and the issues start highlighting themselves when you look at his attacking. His often makes horrible decisions and also plays some quite sloppy passes, he isn't always in the best possible spaces and while acceptable, his dribbling is nothing to write home about. 

https://preview.redd.it/pzg190fszqx31.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8210192bd09b073a3258d456f003f1b1ff2ef45f

This is where I feel Van De Beek comes in. For those who don't know, he is a player at ajax and was a major part of their brilliant champions league run last season. While most people focused on De Jong and De Ligt, it is important to realise that he is the one player that the refused to let go during the transfer window. [Ajax also played in a 4-2-3-1 and Donny played in the advanced midfield role.](https://youtu.be/wyj7uR5iCfk?t=152) He is young so he certainly fits Florentino's new transfer philosophy and is also a die hard Madridista(People dug up past tweets and images/Seen at Bernabeu/Openly talked about it). His offensive contribution is great (10 assists/9 Goals in Eredivisie. Scored against Juventus and Tottenham) and he also presses just like Valverde. Interest in him was widely reported by the media and he himself confirmed that we had contacted him.  I don't really know much about his quirks and don't really have any personal observations as I don't watch Ajax, but his quality and potential are both indisputable imo.

The switch to this new tactic more or less confirms to me that we will definitely be signing Donny in the summer. He will allow Valverde to switch to a role where he can play to his strengths or serve as a more defensive minded option in the same midfield. I think he is basically the only player playing in the 10 role that actually offers any defensive support(Ozil, James, Isco,Dybala,Coutinho and Neymar are all examples) and missing out on him will be a massive mistake by the management.

The shining form and potential of both of these exciting youngsters personally disgusts me from the outlook of signing lazy instagram star Pogba. We will easily spend double of what we spend on Van De Beek and that money would be much better invested in Napoli's Fabian Ruiz in my opinion. He is also a Barca target and signing him would not only weaken our rivals but also sort out our midfield for the next 10 years.

Perez will be going big on Mbappe to appease the socios and the signing of Donny alongside a CDM would basically finish our squad for the upcoming future. We will also have many talented youngsters returning from loan and the squad of all these youngsters has the potential to be one of the best ever in my opinion. There was also the recent interview from Kai Havertz and the way he has been dropping hints is just further building up the excitement and I feel that even if it means we start selling some established players, we need to sign as many of these kind of talented players as possible. 

Players like Nacho, Vazquez, Marcelo, Modric, Bale and Isco have served the club well but I feel if moving them on/them retiring means we can get players like Havertz, Mbappe, Fabian and Donny then I think the club should surely say goodbye to them and go full force towards a complete rebuild of the team. We already have the financial power and the sales and wages of these players will surely generate enough money to get us those signings. 

Whether it is Zidane or some other coach, they will have a wide variety of players to play around with and If we do go for such a drastic rebuild, I can personally vouch that we definitely get a treble along with constant success in the next 10 years due to our insane quality, depth, player potentials and the demands of the players and fanbase

If you managed to read through this much respect to you and also please note that this is just my POV so you don't have to get overly aggressive.

**LEAGUE B**

**Grenada 10 pts., French Guiana 5 pts., St. Kitts and Nevis 4 pts., Belize 3 pts.**

*St. Kitts and Nevis vs Grenada; Belize vs French Guiana*

*French Guiana vs St. Kitts and Nevis; Grenada vs Belize*


With 2 Match Days remaining, Grenada needs one more point from an available six to secure promotion to League A and qualify for the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The Spice Boyz are close to making their return to the continental event, after what would be a 10 year hiatus. French Guiana chase them, and need to win both of their games in order to have the chance of overtaking Grenada come the final standings. And even then, they need the group leaders to slip up elsewhere. The Sugar Boyz of St. Kitts and Nevis are still mathematically alive, but they also need max points AND for Grenada to lose twice this month to potentially overtake them on Goal Differential. Belize cannot win promotion. The lone Central American side in the Group will be battling it out for survival. Since all 4 teams below Grenada are separated by just a couple of points, Group B1 should come down to the wire for who can stay above water.

**El Salvador 9 pts., Dominican Republic 7 pts., Montserrat 5 pts., St. Lucia 1 pt.**

*St. Lucia vs Dominican Republic; El Salvador vs Montserrat*

*St. Lucia vs Montserrat; El Salvdor vs Dominican Republic*

Los Cuscatlecos are in prime position to emerge victors, as they close out B2 with two home games that they will feel they should win. El Salvador are chasing a spot in the CONCACAF Hexagonal, which will be based on the June 2020 FIFA Rankings. Currently on the outside looking in, ELS should quietly favor their odds of cracking the top 6 this November break. But they have slipped up to lesser opposition before in the last year, to the likes of Bermuda and the Dominican Republic. DR will feel confident in their ability to get one over on El Salvador again, but it’ll be a tough task on the road on the final Match Day. This makes the penultimate clash with St. Lucia all the more paramount. Montserrat continue their Cinderella Story, having garnered a respectable record of just 1 loss in their first four fixtures. While they need help to finish as Group winners, avoiding relegation would be a massive accomplishment from a team that is still considered a minnow of the region. St. Lucia stare down the barrel of relegation. A win over Montserrat in Gros Islet is essentially mandatory to escape sinking to League C.

**Jamaica 12 pts., Guyana 6 pts., Antigua &amp; Barbuda 6 pts., Aruba 0 pts.**

*Antigua &amp; Barbuda vs Jamaica; Guyana vs Aruba*

*Aruba vs Antigua &amp; Barbuda; Jamaica vs Guyana*


The Reggae Boyz dominate with all wins and all clean sheets - a demonstration that they arguably shouldn’t have allowed themselves to be placed in League B to begin with. Perhaps the team most clearly on their way to League A and Gold Cup qualification from the mid tier of the CNL, Jamaica also have their sights on the Hex, of which they are in quite healthy position to clinch passage. Running the table in November would certainly be sending a statement. Guyana and Antigua &amp; Barbuda both remain in contention for the second spot in the Group - an important note, as the runners up of each Group in League B will stay viable for Gold Cup qualifying, via the March 2020 Playoffs. The Golden Jaguars, who debuted in the most recent edition of the GC this past June, hold the advantage over the Antiguans, thus far, on Goal Differential and Head to Head. Aruba need a miracle to avoid falling into the cellar.

**St. Vincent and the Grenadines 8 pts., Suriname 7 pts., Nicaragua 7 pts., Dominica 0 pts.**

*St. Vincent and the Grenadines vs Nicargua; Suriname vs Dominica*

*Dominica vs St. Vincent and the Grenadines; Nicaragua vs Suriname*

Officially the first side relegated from League B into C, Dominica are out with only pride to play for. But perhaps they can play spoiler to one of the other teams in what is now a hotly contested 3 horse race for glory. After storming out of the starting gate in September’s window, Suriname took a blow in only amassing one point over Vincy Heat last month, which included a loss at home in Paramaribo. With a slightly more favorable remaining schedule over the Group leaders, Suriname will still be of the belief they can gather themselves and come in clutch for the first round’s closure. Meanwhile, St. Vincent should be lauded for staying undefeated throughout the campaign, a formula that puts them on the cusp of their first Gold Cup in 25 years. Nicaragua made most of their double header with the ill fated Dominicans, but face a tough road ahead in Arnos Vale before finishing off in a clash with the very same Surinamese side that took them to the woodshed two months prior.

[](#sprite1-p3) **Liverpool:**

* Liverpool defender Joel Matip has not recovered from a knee injury and will miss the visit of Manchester City.

* Xherdan Shaqiri remains sidelined with a calf problem.


[](#sprite1-p10) **Man City:**

* A thigh injury forced Ederson off at half-time in the midweek draw at Atalanta and he has supposedly failed a fitness test ahead of the Anfield trip.

* David Silva looks unlikely to play due to a muscular injury of his own and there are also doubts over Rodri (hamstring).

* Oleksandr Zinchenko, Leroy Sane and Aymeric Laporte remain sidelined.

[**Match Facts**](#bar-10-gray)

-------------------------------------------

* Liverpool have only lost one of their last 28 top-flight home games against Man City (1-2 in May 2003), and are unbeaten in their last 16 against them at Anfield in the Premier League (W11 D5).

* After losing four Premier League games in a row against Liverpool between 2015-2016, Man City have lost just one of their last five against the Reds in the competition (W2 D2).

* Man City are winless in their last 16 Premier League away games against Liverpool, their longest such winless streak against an opponent in the competition's history.

* Liverpool have won more Premier League games against reigning champions than any other side in the competition's history (21). Indeed, they haven't lost at home in such a match since December 2007 (0-1 vs Man Utd), winning six and drawing five since.

* This will be the 35th Premier League match between the reigning champions and league leaders - each side have won nine games each (16 draws), with the champions (Man City) beating the leaders (Liverpool) 2-1 in the last such match in January 2019.

* Liverpool have only lost one of their last 50 Premier League games (W41 D8 L1), with that loss coming against Man City in January. The Reds are unbeaten in their last 28 Premier League games, the eighth longest such run in the competition.

* Liverpool have won a league-high 10 points from losing positions this season. The Reds have won their last two Premier League games despite conceding the first goal - they've never done so in three consecutive games in the competition before.

* Manchester City have won 11 of their last 12 Premier League away games, losing only against Norwich in that run (2-3). The Citizens have bagged 30 goals in this period, netting an average of 2.5 goals per game.

* Manchester City have only failed to score in six of their 62 Premier League away games under Pep Guardiola. Three of those games have been on Merseyside (2 vs Liverpool, 1 vs Everton) and the other three have been in London (vs Tottenham, Crystal Palace and Chelsea).

* Despite Liverpool being on the second longest ever unbeaten home run in Premier League history (45 games), the Reds have conceded in each of their last five at Anfield. They last had a longer run without a clean sheet at home in October 2014 (7 games).",soccer,1573381006,_cumblast_,295,1,True,2019-11-10

Several clubs/keepers have had longer clean streaks but never to start a season.

[](#icon-net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

1': We're off!

1': Napoli wins a corner in the first minute and Koulibaly heads it at goal. Gollini saves.

2': Two more saves by Gollini, that's three in the first two minutes. Wake up Atalanta

7': Iličić takes a free kick low at goal! Meret saves and Gosens mishits the rebound!

9': Something happened to Allan. They've taken him off the field, we'll see if he comes back.

11': [](#icon-sub) Napoli substitution: *Piotr Zieliński* on for *Allan*

12': Insigne finds Callejón who fires towards the near post but is denied by an outstretched Gollini!

16': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL NAPOLI!!! It's a perfect cross into the box from Callejón that *Nikola Maksimović* puts into the net with a bouncing header! Beautiful initial pass to Callejón from Insigne to set that up too.**](https://streamja.com/llQe)

20': [](#icon-yellow) *Rafael Tolói* cynically knocks down Lozano

22': Milik somehow doesn't score on a great counterattacking Napoli movement. His header bounces off the post and back to his feet, and he somehow scuffs the shot.

24': Iličić's free kick goes wide of the mark.

37': Insigne's shot is straight at Gollini.

39': Tolói and Djimsiti both go for the same corner kick, Tolói heads it over the goal.

41': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL ATALANTA!! *Remo Freuler* makes a great run down the wing and fires from wide! Meret's gotta save that at his near post but he lets it dribble in off the inside of his leg and it dribbles past him into the net!**](https://streamja.com/LbG6)

**HT Napoli 1-1 Atalanta** It's anyone's game after a frenetic first half! 

------

56': Insigne mishits his shot weakly to the keeper's waiting arms.

59': [](#icon-sub) Napoli substitution: *Dries Mertens* on for *Hirving Lozano*

59': Insigne curls a shot at the far top corner and it's so close!!

61': Luperto tries from distance, sails it over the bar.

64': [](#icon-yellow) *Marten de Roon* carded for pulling down Callejón 

64': [](#icon-sub) Atalanta substitution:  *Simon Kjær* on for *Beram Djimsiti*

66': [](#icon-yellow) *Mario Pašalić* catches Callejón in the head with a high boot

68': Milik chips a free kick over the wall  and bounces it off the crossbar!

69': [](#icon-sub) Atalanta substitution: *Timothy Castagne* on for *Mario Pašalić*

71': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL NAPOLI!!! *Arkadiusz Milik* gets the ball around the keeper and only has to calmly tap it in the rest of the way! What an error from Gollini to get beaten there!**](https://streamja.com/5Q3g)

72': Big miss from Fabián Ruiz! He has a big one-on-one chance but puts it wide of the near post!

74': [](#icon-sub) Atalanta substitution: *Luis Muriel* on for *Papu Gómez*

76': De Roon blasts a bad shot into the sky.

82': [](#icon-sub) Napoli substitution: *Fernando Llorente* on for *Arkadiusz Milik*

84': [](#icon-yellow) *Giovanni Di Lorenzo* commits a bad challenge into Gosens's ankle

85': Meret safely collects a flicked header on target.

86': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL ATALANTA!!! Oh my this is going to be controversial!! Kjaer pulls down Llorente, ref gives no penalty! Atalanta launches a counter on the other end and *Josip Iličić* finishes! The whistles ring down! VAR lets it stand!!!!**](https://streamja.com/5Q3l)

88': [](#icon-red) What a scene! One of the Napoli assistants has been sent off! 

88': [](#icon-yellow) *Lorenzo Insigne* carded for dissent! The ref still being mobbed.

90+1': [](#icon-red) That's *Carlo Ancelotti* sent off too!

90+1': What a save!!!! Iličić's shot at the near post just barely pushed aside by Meret!

90+5': Castagne tries to hit a bouncing header but hits it too far downward, doesn't get enough distance and Meret saves easily.

90+6': Ball bounces over for Callejón, the shot is over the bar though. Possible handball call against Tolói but admittedly his arm was by his side.

**FT Napoli 2-2 Atalanta** It's a big controversial finish for this deeply important match! Both sides walk away with a point but Napoli will feel hard done by.",soccer,1572465607,MisterBadIdea2,175,41,True,2019-10-30

I purchased this Chelsea away shirt with Kanté 7 at the back and all the badges. It cost me $21. How does it look?

In the past I have purchased 2 shirts (Lampard 8 home from 2013 and Hazard 10 away from last season). Those are both authentic shirts, purchased from Chelsea website/megastore and the Nike UK online store respectively. They obviously cost me a lot. I'm a student hence I can't really afford to buy shirts every year and also I prefer buying them with legendary players on the back.

496,Is the implementation of VAR across Europe going as badly as it is in the UK?,"In the UK VAR has been hugely controversial and always manages to grab the headlines for the following reasons:

\- There doesn't seem to be any consistency over when VAR should and shouldn't be used.

\- The ref's don't opt to go to the pitchside monitor, which has proven to result in the 'wrong calls' being made 

\- The in-stadium experience of VAR is terrible (i have had personal experience of this), crowds are left for anything up to 3 minutes of stoppage without knowing what is happening, and then big decisions (disallowed goals etc..) are made without any indication of why.

\- Penalties are given over inconclusive video footage

There are several incidents like this on a weekly basis that end up dominating the conversation around football which is starting to become really tedious.

119,Premier League VAR Simplified,"I'll start by saying I haven't seen a huge amount of footy this weekend- I know there were a handful of controversial decisions which I haven't seen, but I hope I can broadly clear VAR's implementation up (this is Premier League specific as I know other leagues have slightly different VAR rules). 

The thing to me people seem to have missed (from hearing down the pub, and comments both here and elsewhere online) , is that VAR rules entirely on matters of fact. There's no grey, just black and white. 

This means that what VAR doesn't do, is decide how much contact is enough to be a foul. That grey area is left to the on field referee. What it does do (although we haven't had an example yet, off my head), is pulls a referee up when they've called something as black, when it's white. 

An example of this would be where a player dives. In this situation, the ref thinks there's contact, so awards a penalty. VAR would pull this up and overturn the decision. VAR is making a call based purely on matter of fact (contact vs no contact). 

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if there is contact with a player in the box and no penalty is given, it all depends on what the referee has seen and relays to the VAR assistants. If he sees contact, but not enough for a penalty (think pushing/blocking at a corner), VAR won't overturn it, regardless of how much force is involved (unless it's enough for a red card). VAR isn't looking at how much contact (grey), just if there is or there isn't (black and white). 

If a referee doesn't see contact where there is, again that's the point VAR steps in. It's decision making is black and white (can't stress this enough). 

So blame the ref for a bad decision in the grey area, blame those who made this rule up (although you can see where they're coming from on a clear and obvious front), but VAR can only work within the parameters it's given. 

FWIW I'd like to see a captains challenge brought in, maybe 2 per match. This is the point the ref would go over to the screen and has a second look at something, and make his decision based on his level of tolerance in the game so far.  Hopefully we'd get more of these grey decisions right, as the crux of the problem is it depends on the referees one, real time view of an event.",soccer,1571605886,chrisb993,29,0,True,2019-10-20

170,Match Evaluation (Man Utd 1-1 Liverpool),"Manchester United - 1 (Marcus Rashford 36')
Liverpool FC - 1 (Adam Lallana 85')

As an ardent Man Utd fan, watching the match a few hours ago was quite the rollercoaster of emotions, mostly positive. While many would lament the wasted result, I personally feel that Man Utd are slowly finding their true form, in the test of mighty Liverpool.

When the match started, we were explosive. Andreas Pereira was an engine, sweating buckets gliding around the pitch and creating chances. One problem was the fear of crossing on the right flank. Andreas and Aaron were mainky hesitant to whip it in, so I think that can be worked on as Young had to do it anyway. The fluidity was something we always lacked, which was even missing on our opening day thriller against Chelsea.

And that goal, my word. The cross was just sublime, so kudos to James. Liverpool soon found their composure, and it really was threatening. The main duo of Mané and Firmino really looked fearsome, as Mané made several (and key) darting runs while Firmino looked to poach.

In the second half, I feel that it was quite wasted. I don't know what was said in he dressing room,but we shifted to a defensive approach, attacking on the break. Many positives, but also outshadowed by slight negatives. Finally, we could attack on the break. Contrary to popular belief, I think Ole is doing a great job. We have our chances. We are moving well forward. But our finishing. Jeez. Kudos to Liverpool for having a solid back. The Scousers pulled one off very late thanks to a Marcos Rojo blunder, which could have been avoided.

Overall, I liked what I saw. It was definitely better than our worse displays like Crystal Palace or Wolves. I feel that this point signified the hard work that the lads put in and this test against Liverpool shows that United is ready to pull themselves up.",soccer,1571618952,Tedogmo,1,0,True,2019-10-20

United's success just since 1990 would see them place joint-28th on the most successful clubs table when every other club uses their total trophy haul from their entire histories! 

Now, contexualizing their success further and in the grander scheme of all professional sports, I've recently noticed that u/SportsFan591 has been compiling stats on successful teams in different sports. So, having got his/her permission to share their data, you can use the tables to compare United's recent success to all other sports clubs, starting with:

**AMERICAN FOOTBALL -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FootballAmerica/comments/dfbvnp/nfl_teams_with_the_most_trophies/) 

* As you can see, United's success from 1990 onwards comfortably eclipses every American Football teams' historical success. The closest in numbers to United's 43 trophies from this period are the Green Bay Packers with 22 honours.

**CRICKET** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic\_cricket\_clubs\_with\_the\_most\_trophies\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/czi629/domestic_cricket_clubs_with_the_most_trophies_in/)

* United 1990-2019 beats all but three Cricket clubs in trophies won, with two of those three clubs ahead by only two and six trophies respectively.

**HOCKEY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/dit8a8/hockey_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would already be the 3rd most decorated hockey club ever, although they'd be some way behind the top two!

**RUGBY UNION** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby\_union\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/dd469a/rugby_union_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would once again be the 3rd (joint 3rd this time) most decorated rugby union club in history, although just like with hockey clubs, they'd be some way off the top two.

**RUGBY LEAGUE** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby\_league\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyleague/comments/dad3a7/rugby_league_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most/)

* United 1990-2019 would see them finish 6th on the list of the most decorated rugby league clubs in history, and just one trophy away from breaking into the top 5!

**BASEBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball\_teams\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/d3btcg/baseball_teams_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 4th on a list of the most decorated baseball clubs ever, almost 10 trophies above what's needed to crack the top 5!

**HANDBALL** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Handball/comments/cyrfp1/handball_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 10th on a list of the most decorated handball clubs ever, a feat all the more impressive considering that handball is one of the oldest sports historically, with some leagues going back to the beginning of the 20th century.

**AUSSIE RULES** \-  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian\_football\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AFL/comments/d1nn3j/australian_football_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 come 3rd on a list of the most successful Aussie Rules teams ever, just five trophies shy of second placed Norwood.

**BANDY** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy\_clubs\_in\_the\_world\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bandy/comments/d0ow2m/bandy_clubs_in_the_world_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United 1990-2019 would finish 2nd on a list of the most decorated bandy clubs in history, and over 20 trophies ahead of what would be needed to break the top 5.

**PESAPALLO** \- [https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo\_teams\_with\_the\_most\_trophies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pesapallo/comments/d0lgib/pesapallo_teams_with_the_most_trophies/)

* United would comfortably finish ahead of every pesapallo team historically, and by over 25 trophies from the next most successful club.

* United's lowest ranking position would come amongst water polo clubs, but they'd still manage a top 15 place finish in 14th spot.

&amp;#x200B;

United's success in the last 30 years alone would thus already place them in the top 10 of the most decorated clubs ever lists of all but two sports (football itself, where they'd be 28th, and water polo, where they'd be 14th) and the top 5 of all but four sports (football, water polo, handball where they'd be 10th and rugby league where they'd be 6th). It truly is a ridiculous level of success that goes to show how good they and their fans have had it, and in arguably the world's most competitive league to boot.",soccer,1571629101,Cph12345,11,0,True,2019-10-20

194,Drag Me To Hell is the perfect horror film late 2000s America | Brief Analysis,"So.

Sam Raimi's 2009 work ""Drag Me To Hell"" is considered an acquired taste.

The film makes liberal usage of over the top shock value (i.e., think the parking garage fight between Christine and the gypsy, the graveyard scene, etc.).

It's a horror extravaganza that relies on repulsion and a genuine creepiness that borders on the theatrical, giving it an air of hilariousness that, in a bizarre way, makes it charming.

And while the film itself generally has very positive reviews and has been the subject of considerable analysis, ala Christine's implied body dysmorphic eating disorder being a subtle theme of the film, I feel that there's an additional element to ""Drag  Me To Hell"" that has been less explored; a theme that is so brazenly apparent and critical to the plot, that it cannot be anything but seen as fittingly appropriate for it's time.

**It's the perfect film for late 2000s Recession ridden America**

**Also - SPOILERS**

Upon it's release in 2009, Sam Raimi's film had just come at the end of the worst economic crisis in American history since the Great Depression. The Recession, which is considered to have lasted from 2007 - 2009 (if you believe the conservative time frame, many considered it to have lasted longer).

In the film, both the anti-hero Christine's and the antagonist gypsy's fate are greatly tied to their economic strife. Christine, in a bid to impress her boss and to earn a **tensely fought battle for promotion within her company**, assumes the uncomfortable position of denying the seemingly harmless old woman an extension on her home.

In vengeful defiance of the **foreclosure of her home**, she casts a wicked curse on Christine, condemning her to Hell within three days time, but not before being subjected to torment by an evil spirit in the meantime. 

Increasingly desperate as he hour approaches, Christine resorts to extreme lengths to rid herself of the curse before it's too late. One such attempt sees her **pawning off nearly all that she owns in order to obtain the amount of money necessary for a mystic to assist her in her bid to save her soul. She seeks to rectify her debt, at any cost.

The downhill spiral for both of the main characters involved is that of financial burden; a series of inopportune and inconvenient circumstances that lead to the cut throat, dog eat dog reality of hard times experienced in economic stagnation.

Rather than standing there, and the club suffering the consequences, it would be cool to publicist a coordinated crowd response tactic like a chant all other fans could join in directed at the offenders to show solidarity against racism. 

It would be a nice way to show the players support, and would probably be viewed favorably by the leagues when deciding whether to hand out punishment to the club.",soccer,1571674922,RevolutionaryTrain69,1,1,True,2019-10-21
366,Made this Korean flag with LAFC jerseys and Korean jerseys for the MLS playoffs. #MORETHANAFLAG,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/qBEMd6K](https://imgur.com/gallery/qBEMd6K) 

[https://www.instagram.com/raynaldinho\_/](https://www.instagram.com/raynaldinho_/)

Following up with last year’s Korean flag I made out of jerseys of all the nations playing in the World Cup in Russia (#followtheflag), I wanted to make another flag this year that was inspired by LAFC.

The purpose of creating this flag was to shed light on [TSG](https://www.instagram.com/lafc_tsg/) aka Tiger Supporters Group of LAFC, one of the official supporters group recognized by the Club and part of the 3252 as well as push us for the playoffs, starting with our game vs the Galaxy this Thursday. TSG is based in Koreatown, LA and the first supporters group in MLS to highlight and celebrate Koreans and the Korean culture.

The flag is cut and sewn by myself, and each custom name and numbers have a special meaning behind it.

If you’re in the LA area, TSG is hosting a Korean collection merch release event at the LAFC HQ (official LAFC store at the Banc of California stadium) this Tuesday at 7:30pm, and the flag will be displayed there as well.

This is the most insane but completely non-fiction story you will ever see. It is however having trouble getting traction, and getting censored\\banned. Some of the ways this is happening are explained in the update section near the end of the document. Media is currently ignoring this story. This is an effort to create public awareness, so that bribes, blackmail, censorship, and secret deals cannot allow these vile criminals to maintain the status quo, and remain in office.

Billions in bribes were paid to Trump, Pelosi, Schumer, Harris and others to enable a Soros, Koch, and Porter funded child raping ring to operate in the USA. Below will contain excerpts from the 84 page PDF document which can be downloaded near the end of this post. **Please download** **and listen to the links below.** **Turn up the volume and put headphones on.** **You will hear these people and many other high profile people, incriminate themselves in unbelievable fashion.**

1018 Gigi Hadid: Mr President we are child rapists.

1018 Donald Trump: You cannot be serious.

1019 Donald Trump: You’re gonna need $4 billion for me to take a blind eye.

1019 Porter: People are laughing because they think four billion is too much. I think it's not a problem when you have $35 billion.

1022 Donald Trump: You better have that $4 billion or you can kiss this shit goodbye.

1033 Matthew Porter: We appreciate that Speaker Pelosi.

1033 Gigi Hadid: I think we may have to scale back a little bit though.

1033 Nancy Pelosi: Gigi I think we will be just fine.

1035 Nancy Pelosi: God damn it\\! I want Kamala to get a billion out of yours, not out of mine

1035 Gigi Hadid: I think we can accommodate you but we need to find out if Monterrey will be open on the 30th of January.

1036 Nancy Pelosi: Of course it will Gigi...

\\\\Please post this anywhere you can! Create your own posts with this or other excerpt from the PDF. This information keeps getting blocked, censored, 'down/voted' etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes , child murders, and corruption. This is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you've done them the ""service"" as they call it. Please help get the word out. Soon it will no longer be able to be ignored.

A word about the ""faggot"" usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control of the situation, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this, as it was contrary to the picture they were painting. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the telepathic headspace \[see reference item G in the PDF\], which has obvious advantages. Three, it pointed out impersonators of B.S. in the headspace, because they would not call each other “faggot”, and in turn giving themselves away thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended. On that note, I give you former President Barack Obama in a foursome with Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Matthew Porter.

180,When is a DOGSO resulting a PK also a red card?,"I’m looking for help in clarifying a rule (which might have recently been changed) about giving out both a penalty kick (PK) and a red card when there is a denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO).

In particular, I’m thinking about the following case:
- a defender makes an attempt to play the ball, but misses and fouls an attacker that is moving towards the goal
- the foul is caused inside of the penalty area, resulting in a PK
- the defender is technically the last outfield defender. However, there are other defenders in the vicinity
- the attacker was not clearly in possession of the ball - that is, this is a contested ball

IMO this constitutes a DOGSO because the defender was the “last man”. However, since there was a legitimate attempt to play the ball, and there are other extenuating circumstances (attacker not clearly in possession of the ball, and other defenders in the vicinity) I think the defender should be cautioned with a yellow card, and not a red card.

189,CONCACAF Nations League Matchday Recap (10 October 2019,"#League A

**Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹 0–2 🇭🇳 Honduras**  
After Bryan Moya gave Honduras the opening goal in the 52nd minute, T&amp;T's Levi Garcia received his second yellow, making the task of equalizing incredibly daunting. Indeed, the task was too much, Honduras sealed it with a goal in second half stoppage, followed by yet another red card from Trinidad and Tobago. Honduras put themselves on top of the group, looking to cruise through this group.

**Haiti 🇭🇹 1–1 🇨🇷 Costa Rica**  
Despite a big performance from Keylor Navas, Costa Rica have to accept a draw in Haiti. The Ticos still have three matches remaining, so they have to ignore the fact that they are bottom of the table and perform in these upcoming matches. On the other hand, my Curaçao boys have to be pretty happy with this result.

#League B

**French Guiana 🇬🇫 0–0 🇬🇩 Grenada**  
No one could make their mark on this game, not even the clutch minister himself, Jamal Charles. Grenada still stop the group, with half of the matches played.

**Belize 🇧🇿 0–2 🇰🇳 Saint Kitts and Nevis**  *(ONGOING)*  
This match isn't over yet, but I'll just say that Belize are brutal. They will most likely get relegated, perhaps even comfortably. SKN close the gap with the other two, making for an enticing second half of the group stage.

#League C

**British Virgin Islands 🇻🇬 0–4 🇧🇸 Bahamas**  
A brace from Lesly St. Fleur helped the Bahamians to a clean victory. St Fleur's goals extended his all-time leading tally to 9 - with three of them coming against BVI and the remaining six coming against Turks and Caicos Islands. The final match of this group between the Bahamas and Bonaire should be the defining match of this group, unless BVI can step it up and make their mark.

**Sint Maarten 🇸🇽 2–5 🇹🇨 Turks and Caicos Islands**  
This match was a battle between the two nations' all-time top scorers. Gerwin Lake scored twice for Sint Maarten, putting his side up 1–0 and then 2–1, but it wasn't enough to hold back TCI and legend Billy Forbes. Each time Lake scored, Billy responded with a goal of his own, eventually completing his hat-trick from the penalty spot as the last goal in a 5–2 victory for TCI. Lake extended his record goal scoring tally from 3 to 5, while Forbes went from tied for first at four to sole possession of the record at seven!",soccer,1570763449,NoBreadsticks,6,25,True,2019-10-10

First off I think he should be very fit. I will be starting doing some exercises with him to build a little muscle and also train on speed. What ate some exercises you could recommend?

Technical drills - If anyone knows any of these that improve his technical ability, I would love to hear some. I know rondo’s, keepy-ups and hitting a wall are some good ones. What else?

""I've never been this excited for a match before"", Josh King said at a press conference friday, and continued; ""so much is at stake after we threw away those points against Sweden and Romania.""

Norway haven't beaten Spain since the 2000 European Championship group stage, and most recently lost 2-1 away in the mirror match of this qualifier, where King scored Norway's goal.


""To get something against Spain, even at home, every player needs to be 110% focused and have their best day""

Martin Ødegaard thinks Norway's newfound tactic with him in the free role behind the striker from the away game against Sweden will come in handy; ""We will be more unpredictable. That game (against Sweden, 1-1) was the first time we ever tried that tactic, and I became a bit deeper than what was intended. I think the next time we try it will be a lot better. Now Spain has to guess how we'll line up.""

Joshua King previously commented after the Sweden away game that this new tactic was [not his favourite](https://www.vg.no/sport/fotball/i/dOpgez/oedegaards-nye-rolle-ingen-king-favoritt?utm_source=recirculation-matrix&amp;utm_content=70JyB9). ""With how deep Ødegaard was I became very isolated, to win games we need to score goals."" However he has later said that he is not against the 4-4-1-1 if it's tuned a little more for offense. Martin Ødegaard delivered the assist to Stefan Johansen for Norway's goal against Sweden away.

**Norway needs a 1 point minimum against Spain** to keep the direct qualifying chances alive, and then follow it up with 3 points against Romania away. Otherwise, Norway will have to most likely face-off against Serbia through the Nations League route to go through, but it's clear that the Norwegian players are abuzz with the possibility of not just taking the 1 point, but winning.",soccer,1570802252,RedTuesdayMusic,0,21,True,2019-10-11

----


**What are you up to these days?**

Playing football with my neighbours and just trying to live a happy life. After being in the limelight for a long time, sometimes nothing beats that feeling of spending time with the family and taking things easy, so I feel happy. On the career side, I’ve been helping out CAF [the Confederation of African Football] and also helping the young ones to train – not at coaching level, as I don’t think every former footballer should be a coach, but passing on knowledge as and when I can.

**You’ve been very critical of Liverpool in the past. Why do you hold so much resentment towards them?**

Well, I’ve never hidden the fact that Liverpool didn’t treat me right and that they cherished some players better than me, even though I’d arrived with a better profile. Sometimes, reporters will never get what goes on in the club and in the dressing room. Don't get me wrong: : the club is run very well now, based of what I have heard from Sadio Mané, but I feel I was seen as an outsider back then. The upsetting thing is that Real Madrid &amp; Barcelona had offered me more money, but I really wanted to go to Liverpool - and it ended up being one of my worst experiences. 

**And Steven Gerrard? How do you feel about him now?**

When people say I don’t like Gerrard, I laugh, because if I tell you the things he used to say about me to the guys, you wouldn’t be able to write it. For me, it’s all in the past, but I’m not  a hypocrite – I know they don’t like me, so I also don’t like them. Look, I say this and they get offended, but let’s be honest: Gerrard has won nothing for his country. I took my country to the World Cup, and that singular act cannot be quantified. I’m happy for my boy, Sadio, and I'm happy the club is going well now, but on a personal level I’d rather I hadn’t played there.

**What do you expect Liverpool to do in 2019-20? Win the Premier League?**

I don't see them doing as well as they did last season. They had the chance to win the league title; they had it in their hands and then let it slip. They were 7 points ahead around Christmas - how Manchester City got it in the end beats my mind. As they say in England, I think they bottled it. If you have only one defeat in a whole season, surely you can’t say that you didn’t win the league – so it’s hard for me to imagine them having such a similar season and coming out as champions. Manchester City will be the team to beat once again. I like Manchester City and the project there, but I was sad to see Yaya Toure leave them when he did – I felt he could have played for one more season. But that's how football is, and it’s important that we give the manager the benefit of the doubt because of the work he has done.",soccer,1570807928,Varnagel_1,7,0,True,2019-10-11

###[](#sprite9-p8) CSA [1x0](https://youtu.be/qB-k5VRnDAY) Internacional [](#sprite1-p190)

[](#icon-ball) *65’: Jonatan Gómez (CSA).*

The *alagoanos* continued their recovery in the league table by beating out Avaí in the last Brasileirão round, while the *gaúchos* faced problems they drew with crisis-ridden Cruzeiro. In these two teams’ previous encounter, Inter found a solid 2x0 against CSA.  This match put in front of each other Internacional and one of their managers from the infamous 2016 season, where the club got relegated for the first time in their history. As for the game itself, it began the way it was expected, with *Colorado* pressing up high and an occasional *Azulão* counter attack. The hosts had the match’s first real chance to score, but winger Bustamante squandered it. After this incident, the visitors started to imprint their dominance in the initial half, On a couple of instances either being parried by keeper Jordi or hitting the woodwork. Inter did find two goals still in the first 45 minutes, but luckily for CSA both times the opponent’s scorer was offside. For the second half, no substitutions for either side. However, a change of mentality could be seen in the home team’s squad. They came out of their shell and started to attack on their own, something unthinkable considering the previous half of football. *Azulão* had a clear chance to pull ahead in the scoresheet, but once again weren’t able to show good end product. On the other side of things, *Colorado* looked off. The away team had plenty of possession in the first half but couldn’t really translate it to anything meaningful, the problem remained through the second half, with the addendum of not being able to stop their adversary’s attack. Right around the middle of the final half, [a dumb foul by Inter left-back Uendel brought down CSA right-back Dawhan](https://gyazo.com/cd211acebf5a788435e09c5a97b3a739) resulting in a penalty call for the home owners, leading to the match’s only goal. Not much happened after, the hosts retracted to their own side of the pitch again in classic Argel Fucks fashion (Anti-Football™), while the visitors proved time and time again how out of their depth they were when trying to play propositive football. Another victory at home for the Série B promoted side, their 4^th on a row. The Copa do Brasil finalists also entered a 4 match run, but for winless games, yikes.

The recent matches, coupled with another teams’ slip-ups, are surely giving the CSA fans reason to believe in maintaining their spot in the Série A. The club sleeps outside of the relegation zone, 2 points in front of the 17^th placed team. Well, [the sordid defeat cost Internacional manager Odair Hellmann his job](https://twitter.com/SCInternacional/status/1182398639228030979), as the pressure on him grew exponentially after the losses in the Copa do Brasil finals. The board has announced they’ll be looking to sign someone to take temporary control of the team for the remainder of the season, while searching for the right name for next year.

*Timão* flew back home after a goalless draw against Grêmio in the previous Brasileirão round, while *Fhuracão* defeated Bahia in away soil. The last time the teams fought, Athletico Paranaense fielded their reserves and lost 2x0 against Corinthians. In the Itaquerão, the match started according to the hosts’ plan, finding a rather early goal from a set-piece play. The team is known for their strength in defence and their ability to score even though they really shouldn’t. Then the visitors went on to dominate even more possession, passing the ball left and right in order to find one hole in their opponent’s defensive system. Through this movement, the *paranaenses* found a break and midfielder Léo Cittadini plucked the equalizer for them. Despite losing their lead, the *paulistas* didn’t try anything different to prevent their adversary’s plan. Not long after the first goal, Athletico scored one more and consolidated their comeback. Luckily for Corinthians, another set-piece near the box resulted in Argentinian striker Boselli scoring a late equalizer. Uff, a lot of action in the first half, and I haven’t even mentioned the possible penalty who got corrected by VAR. If only the second half followed suit... *Coringão* tried to have more possession, and in consequence propose more instead of waiting out for *Rhubro-Negro*’s actions, but as you could guess it didn’t really work. Neither team had a good final stretch, with only one dangerous chance for each side: veteran striker Vágner Love went 1-on-1 with the keeper but had his shot stopped, while youngster forward Thonny Anderson dribbled past 3 adversaries but was denied a golazo by the goalkeeper. That’s about it for the second half, kinda lacklustre when compared to the first. 

The *corinthianos* continue on the G4, despite the two recent draws. The club continues their discourse of fighting for the title, but aren’t showing much to back up that claim. On the other side, y’all know my opinion on the *athleticanos*’ remaining Brasileirão campaign. [Clue: the fuckwits already have another trophy decision marked on their 2020 calendar](https://twitter.com/AthleticoPR/status/1179858948733771776). I bet Tiago Nunes gets off on spoiling the other team’s ambitions left and right…

399,Pelé ‘s sacrificing routine. “The King Kid is tired”,"&amp;#x200B;

[  ](https://i.redd.it/p0im6gxxbyr31.jpg)

Hello r/soccer!  
 

Im a Brazilian historian, and as many people in my country, football is more than a passion for me, it’s a way of life. Whenever I can I relate football with my professional works.

This morning I was reading “O Cruzeiro” the most popular Brazilian variety magazine among the 1950s and 1960s. As you can imagine, football was a frequent subject on the pages of O Cruzeiro.  
 

On a edition from January 10 I found a small, but quite interesting article about Pelé’s carreer on that moment entitled “The King Kid is tired”. It made me think about a lot of stuff I read here.   
   
**Introduction**

Pelé is an unquestionable heroe in Brazil, and also a very rated player everywhe. But on this sub is really common read some relativization of Pelé’s brilliant path on the form of coments like “Pelé played against farmers”, “The defenders from the 1960s are really poor”, “On contemporary football, Pelé would never do what he done”. At the same time, r/soccer is a place of really interesting content sharing about different aspects of the beautiful game.  
 

My intention here is give an approach about Pelé’s carrer using sources from his times. Im really agreed with the sentence ““On contemporary football, Pelé would never do what he done” but is important think on the opposite way, like “Contemporary footballers would do what Pelé did on the 1950s and 1960s?”. I really think they wouldnt.

Some stuff is really hard to worlwide fans get. Brazil on Pelé’s time had not a proper national league. Our country have basically the size of the whole Europe and was really poor comunicated on those times. Some of Pelé’s greatest conquers was on São Paulo State League. Is importante to point that São Paulo’s population is, and was already, bigger than most of European countries. Is also necessary know that just a few Brazilian players made their carrers on Europe before the 1980s. And also, that on the 1950s Brazil was recognized as a football powerhouse on Europe, so, both national team and club team excursion trips for Europe was quite common on Brazilian football.

Despite published on January 1960, “The King Kid is Tired” was probably wrote a few months before. On those times, was common magazines wait a little to publish elaborate articles, and also, the writings point that Pelé has “18 years” when he was accomplished 19 on October 1959. Anyway, is a really valuable source to understand how Brazilian, and worldwide, football works before the stblishment of regular leagues and the complete professionalization of the players. Let’s remember that in most parts of world, football was just professionalized on the 1920s or 1930s, or even after WWII. So, we are talking about a complete different world, where a player like Pelé had a contract with the “Brazilian Army Selection” just because the Army have a massive influence on Brazilian society, big enough to have the best player avaliable for friendlies.  
 So, I will made a free translation of this article. I apologize for the several English errors. I can understand English, but im not properly fluent and struggle to read. Hope you appreciate!  


 **The King-Kid Is Tired (Neil Ferreira/George Torok, published on Revista O Cruzeiro, January 10, 1960)** 

The word rest is scratched of Brazilian football’s King Kid dictionary. The excepcional qualities of the player (and even keeper), who guided Pelé to na unique position on the world sports scenario, charge a heavy tax: his average of attendance on the fields is another record who Pelé just beat. On just 14 days, he played 7 games – defending Santos and the Army Selection. His physical fatigue is big: Pelé loses three kilos per game. He almost have no time to recover. Just the power of his 18 years – says the doctors – allows Pelé keep this rythm without any apparent injuries. The situation is unlikely to change on the future: he will play for every National Team games abroad, just like Santos excursions \[for Europe\] have Pelé’s appearance with a mandatory clause. Keeping on this way, where he will arrive?

“Im not an Ironman”  
 

It’s amazing, but it’s not the almost magnetic attraction by the Spanish” pesetas” \[Pesetas was the currency of Spain on the 1960s. This a refference to Brazil and Santos trips for Europe\] who are deeply threatening the presence of fabolous Pelé on the next oficial Brazilian national team games. What it’s threatening it is exhaustion. Pelé is being quickly burned by the absurd requirements of the professional regime by the whom he is being enslaved. He is indispensable for his team, Santos FC, for the Army Selection and the National Team. Pelé, who keeps breaking records estblished by the most famous goalscorers keep another one for his collection: appearences on the field. São Paulo’s four most famous “experts” on sports medicine are unanimous on point that on his current rythm of play Pelé will struggle to play the 1962 World Cup

\[He really struggled. Pelé was part of the Brazilian victorious team on 1962, but just played the first two games. He was benched by injury for the rest of that World Cup\]

\-Losing three kilos por game and playing four times by week without take the trainings on account, not even an extremely fit person could endure. And Pelé is not extremely fit. Just his extraordinary capacity of recover (and we dont know how long he will keep it) permits Pelé endure this rythm. Anyways and by any price he have to rest. 

But the thing is Pelé just can rest when he is sent off (this rarely happens) or when he suspended by the Sports Justice Court. But when he haves the “joy” of being prized with a disciplinary punishment an ""apellation” shows up and there is Pelé, again on the field. Where, we have to say, he plays even as goalkeeper, he already saved his team of an embarassing situation, mading spectacular saves. Whitout complaints, but with a downcast contenance, Pelé defines his situation on simple but strong words

\-I am tired.  
 

Pelé is hunted by defenders, like he was a beast. But rarely have injuries. Pelé is hard to hit. However, piecemeal, his production on the field is falling and he visible shows wear. So he steps down. And fans call him a “luxury player”. Why this happens? Pele is incisive on his answer:

\-Because im not an Ironman.

And, whitout any gesture, with simplicity he takes a notebook:

\-This is not exactly like a daily... but here I point all my activities. Take a look on this.

The masseuse calls Pelé. It’s bathhub time. One of the methods Pelé uses for relax his muscles. Daily he spends half-hour submerged on a hot brine. And the reports points the Pelé’s notebook chosen excerpt

“Day 4, night, game against Comercial, at Santos. Lalá (goalkeeper) is injuried. I played as goalkeeper. Was hard. Day 5, presentation on Army HQ, in São Paulo. Training with the Army Selection, today and tommorow. Day 7, I comeback to Santos for playing on the morning anda t noon trip for Jaú – its quite far. Day 8, game at Jaú. Trip back on the same day. Day 9, arrive in Santos at dawn, follow to São Paulo at morning. On the afternoon, training with the Army crew. Day 10, something for Piquete, where we will play. The game was tought. Day 11, 4 AM, I arrive at Santos”. 

Necessary add that (trainings apart) Pelé played, at São Paulo on day 15 against Nacional, at Santos on day 17 against Grêmio, at Rio de Janeiro on days 18 and 20 on the South-American Army Championship ando n day 21 he went to Porto Alegre for a Brazil Cup game. After a shower, Pelé roll up a tollie on his body and put his notebook on the cabinet, strech himself at a bench and end up the conversation

\-Today I have a break, just two hours training.",soccer,1570817177,brazilian_liliger,20,133,True,2019-10-11

480,Giroud is actually a god in attack with DD system," 

There  is literally no player in the world that complements DD system better  than Giroud. When he was subbed out they lost their target man and  looked much more lost in midfield after they tried a few air balls that  Ben Yedder didn't even get close to colleting, allowing for Iceland to  finally mount some pressure. Only complete and utter morons don't see  that. He complements both griezmann and Mbappe and France can actually  afford to play 3 destructors mid and be almost unbreakable in defense  because they can get the ball upfield by bypassing them cuz Giroud will  collect it. This alone - the fact they can play 3 destructors makes  Giroud a golden boy. Remember how good modrič was? Well ... not in the  finals. Why? Here is your answer. They just snuff out every semblance of  life in midfield

Its ugly, but at the same time its genius

What  amazes me is that nobody actually bought Giroud and tried to copy the  world cup winner playstyle. France does not play pretty but they play  with absolute control.

I mean the  guy won them world cup, was literally only player that created 2 chances  and still morons think he doesn't deserve top spot?

&amp;#x200B;

Which makes me wonder. Why you guys think nobody is copying france playstyle? Too ugly for a show maybe?",soccer,1570827450,zarafrustralala,0,0,True,2019-10-11

84,VAR has a lot to learn from TMO,"TMO (Television Match Official) is Rugby's version of VAR. 
I was watching the rugby world cup and there is so much I now hate about football because of it. 
1. The ref has a mic throughout the game and at home, you can hear everything that he/she says. 
2. The players are disciplined, if the ref makes a decision, only the player in question + the captain are brought in to discuss. 
3. When the ref goes up to TMO, all mics are active for the fans to listen to - the ref on the field + the TMO + the linemen. 
4. Bad tackles are reviewed multiple times and then a public decision is made so all players understand why and do not repeat the issue. 
5. Bans are in weeks - not games, making it even more painful when you do get banned. Each red card is evaluated for a ban.


These are just a FEW of the points I've noticed.

126,"Following up Man U vs Arsenal, what is the best/worst match you have ever seen live?","When it comes to watching bad matches live, I'm probably one of the more experienced individuals you can find. Even though my grandfather raised me to be Palmeiras through and through, his family moved from Sorocaba (São Paulo state) to Caxias do Sul (Rio Grande do Sul state) in the early 90's, and a few years later I was born, and had no actual means to go watch Palmeiras in another state. So my father (who doesnt even like footy), being supportive of my passion for the sport, thought it was cool to take me to the Alfredo Jaconi stadium to watch our (most succesful) local team, Juventude!
Juventude doesn't have many titles, but they did conquer a State Championship at the end of the 90's and most notably, the Copa do Brasil (BR national cup) in '99 against Botafogo in a completely packed Maracanã (133k people according to Wikipedia).
You may know some players that played in Juventude, such as Naldo (from the Bundesliga, and most recently Monaco) and Thiago Silva (yes, that one). Also Cafu had a brief stint at the club, although it was more of a power play to take him from São Paulo to Palmeiras (citation needed).

ANYWAYS THE POINT IS: Juventude is a terrible, terrible team, and while my fondest memories of watching games in stadiums come from watching Palmeiras, I can say that the worst games I've ever watched live are Juventude's. However, the absolute BEST match I have ever watched live is probably Juventude 3 x 3 Atlético Paranaense, in 2004.
Juventude started behind by 2 goals, and close to the ending of the first half the striker Da Silva put one in the net, only for Atlético to score on back, ending half time at 1-3 for the visitors. However in the second half, Da Silva would get his brace and Naldo would tie up the game 3-3. The whole atmosphere in the stands, the whole crowd singing even though they were down by 2 goals most of the game seemed to be pushing the players to a new limit. And while I'll never forget that amazing experience, there were plenty of embarassing games to watch. See, Juventude's downfall started in 2007, when they got relegated to Serie B in the national league, and from then on, the team literally pilled relegation after relegation ending up in rock bottom of brazilian football, so you can imagine what type of awful games I had to endure.

Anyways, I feel like this was mostly  write up on Juventude, but I would love to hear everyone's stories about good/bad matches that they attended to, and sorry if the post was too long, but hey, maybe you can make your reply as long!

227,[OC] Does Bayern Munich buy the players away from the rivals? Analysis of transfers over the last two decades,"# Introduction

Everyone knows the saying: ""Bayern Munich buys away the players from its rivals"". I don't want to discuss here whether this procedure would make sense or not. Rather, I would like to use a quantitative approach to check the truth of this statement. I first analysed the transfers Bayern Munich has made over the last 20 years and quantified them using the methodology described below. In order to make this figure more meaningful, comparative values are of course required. For this reason, I did the same for Borussia Dortmund, the rival of recent years.

&amp;#x200B;

# Methodology

How can rivals be quantified? If two clubs are similarly placed, they can be described as direct competitors or rivals. Of course, this consideration excludes classic derbies, but in the case of Bayern Munich this would mean that they only get players from 1860 Munich, Nuremberg, etc. … Doesn't make sense, right? That’s why I took the previous season's table as a guide for the transfers of each transfer window. Transfermarkt.com was used as source. The following therefore applies:

* Each difference in positioning equals one point
* The points of all transfers within a period are summed up
* The sum is then divided by the number of transfers to obtain an average 
* Transfers during the winter period are considered summer transfers for simplicity's sake
* Loans are also considered as transfers (little or no impact on results)
* Logically only transfers within the same league are considered

&amp;#x200B;

# Example

With the help of an example, the procedure should be easy to understand. Bayern Munich signed the following players in 2019:

* Lucas Hernández (Atlético Madrid, SPA)
* Benjamin Pavard (VfB Stuttgart, GER)
* Michaël Cuisance (Borussia Mönchengladbach, GER)
* Philippe Coutinho (FC Barcelona, SPA)
* Ivan Perisic (Inter Milan, ITA)
* Fiete Arp (Hamburger SV, GER2)
* Lars Lukas Mai (Bavaria Munich II)

The following players are relevant for the analysis:

* Benjamin Pavard (VfB Stuttgart, GER)
* Michaël Cuisance (Borussia Mönchengladbach, GER)

The teams mentioned above have achieved the following rankings in the previous season:

* Bayern Munich: 1st
* Borussia Mönchengladbach: 5th
* VfB Stuttgart: 16th

Calculation:

( (|1-5|) + (|1-16|) ) / 2

= (4 + 15) / 2

= 19 / 2

= 9,5

Interpretation:

What do these numbers mean? The calculated value indicates that the seller club was on average 9.5 placements away from Bayern Munich. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Results

||**Bayern Munich**|**Borussia Dortmund**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Total Transfers**|92|130|
|**Transfers within Bundesliga**|44|38|
|**Transfers from foreign leagues**|46,7%|54,6%|
|**Average placement seller club**|7,727|8,368|
|**Average distance placement**|6,273|6,184|

The analysis shows that Bayern Munich bought slightly fewer players from foreign leagues (46.7% vs. 54.6%) and was therefore more active within Germany, especially in the Bundesliga (44 vs. 38 transfers). However, it should be noted that the average placement of the seller's club is very similar (7.727 vs. 8.368). Due to the fact that Bayern Munich had the better average rankings in the last two decades, Borussia Dortmund has a smaller average distance to the seller club (6.273 vs. 6.184). So if you take it exactly, Borussia Dortmund, according to this analysis, is more *likely* to buy players from *rivals* than Bayern Munich do.

&amp;#x200B;

# Regarding Interpretation

I am aware that this approach neglects the role played by each player in the selling club. Michaël Cuisance did not play the same role for Borussia Mönchengladbach as Lewandowski or Hummels did for Borussia Dortmund. The analysis could be extended to include minutes played in the previous season, perhaps even several seasons to do justice to injured players. However, I doubt that this would have a big influence on the results. After all, we're looking at the difference to the positioning of the other teams. Borussia Dortmund, for example, hired Marco Reus from Borussia Mönchengladbach, who was undoubtedly a very important player for Gladbach. Quite a few would see Gladbach as a direct rival for the Champions League places. So, it is not about the best method, but about a sufficiently good one. For this reason, the results should rather be interpreted as an indicator than as a final result.

##[](#sprite1-p100) Flamengo 0x0 São Paulo [](#sprite1-p101)
[](#icon-red-ball)

**Flamengo get denied by a superb showing from São Paulo’s defence.**

On the previous Brasileiro round, this match’s hosts continued their win streak by defeating Internacional, while the visitors lost against Goiás in disappointing manner. Flamengo and São Paulo’s last encounter ended in a 1x1, despite the former’s XI for the game being composed of reserve players. For this encounter, *Mengão* rested a couple players, but not a complete team compared to last time. Under new management, again, *Soberano* fielded a team very much alike to their previous round’s one. Considering the circumstances surrounding the *paulistas*, their posture for the game couldn’t been anything less than sitting back and looking for counters. The *cariocas* tried hard to break down the visitors’ defence, but were denied by keeper Tiago Volpi. Still in the first half, São Paulo had a goal rightfully disallowed by an offside. For the second 45 minutes, the hosts subbed on their starters who were resting. The changes proved effective, especially considering the difference in quality between the key players and their replacements. However, Flamengo kept being stopped by Volpi in all attempts. When the ball actually got in, an offside call saved the *Tricolor Paulista*. The *Urubu* didn’t get much challenge on their end, outside of maybe one dangerous chance for the opponents. A goalless draw that in no way, shape, or form, was a drag. Nice. *Side note: During this midweek, Flamengo will travel south in order to face Grêmio, it’ll be the first leg of their Copa Libertadores semifinal affair.*

The *cariocas* remain in 1^st place with 一 thanks to Sunday’s results 一 3 points separating them from the runners-up. Sucks to drop their immaculate record at home, but all eyes are on their middle of the week match. As for the *paulistas*, feels like a bullet was dodged after giving their new manager a debut against the leaders. They dropped from a Copa Libertadores spot for now, but the beginning of Diniz’s reign should prove enough to replenish the supporters hopes for the remainder of the season.

##[](#sprite1-p90) Corinthians [1x0](https://youtu.be/iY6lFMBih1A) Vasco da Gama [](#sprite1-p265)
[](#icon-ball) *59’: Ralf (COR).*

**Corinthians defeat Vasco, but the match’s highlight was the VAR show.**

Neither the *paulistas* nor the *cariocas* played in the tournament’s previous round. However on the last Brasileirão round they played, *Timão* won against Bahia and *Vascão* drew with Athletico Paranaense. And on the last time they played each other for the Campeonato Brasileiro, a boring 1x1 draw between Vasco and Corinthians. Both teams fielded their best available team, looking for immediate responses to their supporters. The first half was a drag, with very few moments of enthusiasm from each side. Whenever one team got in front of the goal, the players’ shots let the viewers down. One highlight of the half was the long time needed for the referee to invalidate a bizarre *Timão*’s goal. Despite the [foul by centre-back Manoel](https://gyazo.com/8037ce3b3ff7abe7577370ce9feef0d9), the ref with the assist of VAR took about 5 minutes to make a decision, yikes. The sides returned a little better from the break, being accentuated by an early goal from the *Gigante da Colina*. However, the score remained intact after [VAR checkage of a very dubious offside call](https://imgur.com/J8KL6RL). A couple of moments before this controversy, Corinthians grew within the game, reaching their winning goal. A golazo by veteran defensive midfielder Ralf, one of the club’s most liked players. With the disadvantage at the score, Vasco started to take control of the match, making subs in order to breathe new life into the team. Their late pressure almost bared fruits, but they weren’t so lucky. To close things off, another irregular goal was invalidated by VAR, this time without much fuzz (and delay). Well, for the home team another win to up their morale after the tragic end to their Copa Sulamericana campaign, as the dire atmosphere surrounding coach Carille seems to fade bit by bit. On the other corner though... Let’s just say that neither [manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo](https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/vasco/noticia/luxemburgo-cobra-posicao-de-gaciba-apos-gol-anulado-do-vasco-vem-dizer-o-que-aconteceu.ghtml) nor [chairman Alexandre Campello](https://twitter.com/VascodaGama/status/1178776043815145475) are taking the VAR situation lightly. *Side note: Both teams will have midweek affairs for postponed matches of the 21^st round. Corinthians will travel south in order to face Chapecoense, while Vasco da Gama will visit Atlético Mineiro.*

The *corinthianos* finally enter the G4 after a spell out of there. The board, and now the manager, keep mentioning their desire to fight for the Brasileirão title, maybe the /r/madlads weren’t playing around? On the other side, the *vascaínos* see the Z4 on their rear window. The tough following matches will certainly keep everyone, players and supporters, up at night.

##[](#sprite1-p190) Internacional [1x1](https://youtu.be/xanDF-W0JMI) Palmeiras [](#sprite1-p142)
[](#icon-ball) *27’: Patrick (INT); 57’: Willian (PAL).*

**Inter and Palmeiras split halves.**

*Colorado* returned home after a controversial defeat to Flamengo. While *Verdão* demolished poor CSA. On their last encounter for the league, Palmeiras defeated Internacional by the slimmest margins in a 1x0. A top of the table clash with both teams fielding their best players? In my good christian Brasileirão 2019??? Yes, it happened, I swear. The hosts started the match better than anticipated, but also kinda expected considering their track record. They limited the visitors to just a few chances in the first 45 minutes, while being able to attack reliably. The lead came after a nice cross came at just about the height for handyman Patrick to head it in. *Porco*’s reaction started after being taken aback from the first half goal, however their equalizer only came in the second half. The levelling goal solidified the team’s good performance in the last 45 minutes. Opposed to before, *Saci* started being pressured in their part of the pitch. The clash outside the four lines continued, with subs being made left and right. The comeback goal for Palmeiras came around the last moments of the game, but it couldn’t be a Campeonato Brasileiro match without some VAR shenanigans to add the cherry on top. This week’s hotly debated point was [the play leading up to the winning goal](https://gyazo.com/48c23c8bdb6aa771653ec1148db2967c). I’m kinda done with the whole soap opera surrounding this round, so I’ll leave it for you to decide. To top off the drama, after the match ended Internacional fans chanted loudly against manager Odair Hellmann. Geez Louise.

*Colorado* drops from a direct qualification spot for next Libertadores’ group stage, putting more and more pressure over manager Odair’s head. The situation at the moment is cloudy. *Porco* waste a rare chance to diminish their distance to the league leaders. The VAR intervention on their possible winning goal will certainly be this week’s hot topic, [especially considering the comments after the match…](https://globoesporte.globo.com/rs/futebol/brasileirao-serie-a/noticia/apos-polemica-em-gol-anulado-galiotte-cita-flamengo-para-pedir-arbitragem-igual-ao-palmeiras.ghtml)

##[](#sprite1-p187) Santos [2x0](https://youtu.be/N_nQOtU-1JU) CSA [](#sprite9-p8)
[](#icon-ball) *36’: Carlos Sánchez (SAN); 58’: Eduardo Sasha (SAN).*

**Santos brush CSA aside.**

The *paulistas* slipped up in the last round, drawing with Fluminense after pulling ahead in the score. While the *alagoanos* would rather not remember their previous outing for the Brasileirão, a beating by Palmeiras. The last time Santos and CSA faced each other, an electric 0x0 draw took place. The sides were looking for immediate bouncebacks after their respective results in the 21^st round, however pretty much only one team dominated the actions of the game. The visitors retracted into their part of the field and stayed there throughout the first half, a clear effort to prevent the occurrences of their previous Brasileirão game. Despite being all up on their opponents’ face, the home team struggled to break the deadlock. In order to drill one in, the hosts counted with a little helping hand from a *Azulão* defender. The penalty sealed the first half’s dull affair, paving way to even more boring times ahead. *Peixe* continued their press, not long before finding another goal. With a comfortable lead, the *paulistas* started to get sloppy, with the byproduct of yet another centre-back sending off for them. It has already happened a couple times, and looks like it will keep happening again. Despite things getting easier for them, the *alagoanos* just weren’t on their day. The little press they attempted after the red card didn’t create any meaningful danger to their adversaries’ lead. A sordid end of match.

Santos get back to winning ways and, more importantly, stabilize their position in the tourney’s G4. Fuck it, let’s go further: not only they get back to winning ways, but enter the title race once again, lowering their points difference to the leaders to 8. As for CSA, all eyes on their next game. The club knew this run of games were tough, so given the circumstances they’ll try to not think about the last few games too much.
    
##[](#sprite1-p228) Fluminense [2x1](https://youtu.be/5IjMj5HmbdU) Grêmio [](#sprite1-p130)
[](#icon-ball) *6’: Nenê (FLU); 49’: Caio Henrique (FLU); 74’: Patrick (GRE).*

**Fluminense defeat Grêmio’s reserves.**

On the league’s 21^st round, *Nense* drew with Santos in a heated game. While *Imortal* thumped Avaí mercilessly. The visitors fielded a fully rotated squad, resting key players for their midweek game. The game started with a bang, a goal in Fluminense’s first shot of the match. Despite playing their reserves, Grêmio held possession and created a couple of chances in the first half, but nothing of real substance. Returning from the break, the *cariocas* added to their advantage with a neat goal from defensive midfielder turned left-back Caio Henrique. The *gaúchos* continued trying to press in order to salvage something out of the game, but not finding any luck. After knocking and knocking, the *Imortal* plucked one goal back, but it was pretty much it for the match. A couple instances revolving penalties calls became the game’s point of discussion: in special [a controversial handball](https://gyazo.com/790b92ea208e281caf74cb2e90ee7799) and [a harsh-looking coming together](https://gyazo.com/2c6acd1e8fa884e401c9aede12597417). I’ll let y’all make up your own minds, but all I’m saying is fuck this shit. Fuck handballs against my fucking team too, yet another instance where we get the short end of the stick in this scenario. But at the same time, it kinda didn’t need to be called as our stupid penalty record is fucking shit. Shieeeeeeeeeet, I’m mad. *Side note: The fuckwits who stayed in Porto Alegre will play during the middle of this week. Grêmio will host Flamengo for the first leg of their Copa Libertadores semifinal clash.*

The *cariocas* get out of the relegation zone once again, may this time be for good. Following this result, maybe interim Marcão will enter the discussion for the vacant manager post. The *gaúchos* drop their chance to get into one of the Pré-Libertadores 2020 spots. However their main focus was, and is, on the midweek match for this year’s Libertadores semifinal.

##[](#sprite1-p201) Atlético Mineiro [2x1](https://youtu.be/974ybNPcf_k) Ceará [](#sprite4-p346)
[](#icon-ball) *43’: Thiago Galhardo (CEA); 55’: Rómulo Otero (CAM); 81’: Luan (CAM).*

**Atlético cling back to overcome Ceará.**

The hosts didn’t play for the league’s previous round. However on the last time they played for the Brasileirão, the *mineiros* lost to Avaí. Despite being in front of their fans the visitors slipped up in the last round, only managing a scoreless draw against Cruzeiro. On these teams’ previous clash, a late winner sealed Atlético’s 2x1 win against Ceará. Looking to break out of their horrid runs of form, the two sides fielded their strongest XI. The majority of the first half didn’t pan out as well both teams had hoped, with not many shots on target. Things got better after [a weird penalty call](https://gyazo.com/9958d14d3f6216bc1d324ec49128b539) gave the lead to the visitors, infusing a much needed sense of urgency in the home team’s players. They tried to level things out still in the first 45, but were stopped by the away team’s goalkeeper. Momentum carried forward for *Galo*, returning from half time pumping chances at *Vozão*. The equalizer came not long after the return to the pitch, a rebound plucked by Venezuelan attacking midfielder Otero. Continued pressing from the hosts saw the visitors crumble into pieces, forcing their keeper Diogo Silva to pull save after save. Close to the final stage of the second half, the comeback was sealed thanks to the perseverance of the squad. A huge sigh of relief for the *mineiros*, who can refocus on their Campeonato Brasileiro campaign once again. One more match to worry over for the *cearenses*, who could taste the end of their mini-crisis right there, but let it escape on the second half... *Side note: The victors will have a match during this midweek, their postponed 21^st round one. Atlético Mineiro will receive Vasco da Gama in their lair.*

Atlético finally end their horrid run of consecutive losses! Following the club’s elimination from the Copa Sulamericana, one might wonder if they’ll still be able to fight for a place in next year’s Copa Libertadores via Brasileirão. While one team gets out of their slump… Ceará add one more misfortune to their 8-match streak without a single win. The atmosphere at the club is grim at the moment.

##[](#sprite1-p443) Athletico Paranaense [1x1](https://youtu.be/WRtppDf1zyE) Chapecoense [](#sprite4-p397)
[](#icon-ball) *30’: Arthur Gomes (CHA); 56’: Nikão (CAP).*

**Athletico’s press only results in a tie against Chapecoense.**

In the previous round, *Fhuracão* hosted Fortaleza and thrashed them. *Verdão do Oeste* didn’t play during the midweek. But on the last round they played, a defeat to Internacional away from home. The last Athletico and Chape encounter ended on a 1x1 draw, kinda disappointing for the *catarinenses* as the *paranaenses* fielded an alternative side. Despite the possible early vacations, the *athleticanos* fielded their key players up against *ChapeTerror*. The disparity in quality showed throughout the match, with an absurd amount of chances for the home owners against the visiting team. However, even though under pressure from kick-off, the visitors managed to open the score on one of their rare counters. The hosts continued their unrelenting press till the end of the first half, after grabbing some air for the remainder of the game. Their equalizer came early in the second half, after a distant freekick from attacking midfielder Nikão. *Fhuracão* continued to push forward, but their scoring chances ended up either hitting the woodwork or being parried by Chapecoense’s keeper. The *catarinenses* ended the match with a strong sense of luck after escaping a defeat despite the pounding throughout the 90 minutes, a real downer for the *paranaenses* as their multiple chances resulted in only one single goal. *Side note: The league’s bottom placed team has a midweek encounter. Chapecoense will go back home and host Corinthians this Wednesday.*

Athletico drop points at home, boo hoo. [They must be so sad about it, I can’t really imagine](https://twitter.com/AthleticoPR/status/1177690514516258817). One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, and so is this away point for Chape. The club will remain in last place for this round, but this doesn’t diminish their feat of getting a result in the Arena da Baixada.

##[](#sprite5-p7) Fortaleza [1x0](https://youtu.be/jIqxk7GUQpc) Botafogo [](#sprite1-p261)
[](#icon-ball) *60’: Marcelo Benevenuto (FOR/OG).*

**Fortaleza return to winning ways against Botafogo.**

*Leão* travelled back home with a sore defeat, courtesy of Athletico Paranaense, on their backs. While the *Estrela Solitária* didn’t do much better, losing to Bahia away from home. On their 3^rd round match, a controversial 1x0 win for Botafogo, which steamed some harsh VAR remarks by Fortaleza. The game was marked by the debut of new old manager Rogério Ceni, returning home after a dry spell in Belo Horizonte. With the debutant, returned the 4-2-4 tactic. On one of the match’s first shots, the *botafoguenses* had a goal disallowed after VAR caught an offside position from veteran player Diego Souza. Despite not holding possession, the hosts managed to attack more effectively than the visitors. Create a couple of chances before the half time mark, including a shot hitting the woodwork. Early on in the second half, another goal was invalidated after VAR checkage, [yet another offside call](https://imgur.com/yJ8Xpq0). This didn’t stop the *leoninos*’ impetus, arriving in an opener a brief moments after the previous effort. The hosts kept going, but couldn’t improve their advantage. In the same vein, the visitors couldn’t really find an adequate reaction to try and tie the match. A nice win for the returning manager of Fortaleza, and a concerning loss for the pressured manager of Botafogo.

*Leão* find a win after their 4-match streak struggling to get 3 points. They continue to distance themselves from the relegation zone, and enter one of the spots dedicated to Copa Sulamericana 2020 qualification. *Fogão* continue staggering through this second half of the championship, reaching their 3^rd consecutive loss. The club is still a safe distance away from the Z4, but will have to stay alert to keep the 8 points difference right about there.

##[](#sprite2-p373) Avaí [0x2](https://youtu.be/83YR20cmPGE) Bahia [](#sprite2-p480)
[](#icon-ball) *24’: Élber (BAH); 27’: Nino Paraíba (BAH).*

**Avaí fall prey to Bahia.**

The hosts returned home after a night to forget in Porto Alegre, a massive bollocking by Grêmio in their last Brasileirão outing. While the visitors managed to bounce back, winning in front of their fans against Botafogo. The previous time Avaí and Bahia faced each other, the *baianos* won by a simple 1x0 against the *catarinenses*. One of the few changes in the squads from the last round, Lucas Frigeri sat between the sticks for Avaí after their starter got injured. The hosts had the first chance of the match, but it was the visitors who broke the scoreline. A few minutes after their opening goal, *Bahêa* found another after a deflected shot went in. *Leão da Ilha* managed to pluck one back, but were denied by an offside call. This became pretty much the best chance they had throughout the game, pointing the effectiveness from Bahia’s defensive system. Avaí’s second half substitutions tried to claw back the match, but the side ended up denied by another key performance from opponents’ goalkeeper Douglas Friedrich. The inability of the hosts to generate a more pressing response seems worrisome for the club, especially considering their difficulties in the championship. On the other corner, things are looking bright for the visitors. Their surprisingly great campaign is one of the best stories of this Campeonato Brasileiro.

Avaí’s misery is starting to pile again. After their good results in the latter stages of the tourney’s first half, the two latest results are less than ideal and don’t give much hope. However they’ll certainly refocus for their next match, a direct clash against another team in the Z4. Bahia finally reach their dream position on the table, a place on next year’s Copa Libertadores is a feat that can’t be understated. Hopefully they manage to keep riding this great form till the end of the championship. 

##[](#sprite2-p340) Goiás [1x0](https://youtu.be/LQI4Zt7L_Q8) Cruzeiro [](#sprite1-p196)
[](#icon-ball) *62’: Alan Ruschel (GOI).*

**Goiás aggravate Cruzeiro’s crisis.**

The *goianos* stunned São Paulo in the last Brasileirão round, winning in front of their opponent’s fans. While the *mineiros* stopped in their adversary’s keeper and drew with Ceará. In their previous match, Cruzeiro managed to defeat Goiás by 2x1. Following the controversies going on at Brazilian football, new manager Abel Braga had [a couple of thoughts he let slip before the game](https://twitter.com/globoesportecom/status/1178807549455486977). Considering his stance on players and managers feuds during this season, funnily enough his chosen XI included the presence of troublemaker Thiago Neves, a major catalyst to the previous manager’s sacking. The first half saw moments of dominance being switched between the teams. *Raposa* going up first with their dangerous chances, followed by a spell from *Esmeraldino*’s ones, and then ending the half on another moment of attacks from the former. Coming from the break, the visitors managed to open the score, but [another millimetric offside call got checked by VAR](https://imgur.com/SCWRUt3) and the goal was invalidated. The hosts started to react as their opponents seemed to lose focus. Thanks to a fuck-up in the away team’s defence, famous player Alan Ruschel scored his team’s winning goal, the survivor of the ‘16 plane crash transfered to Goiás in order to prove his worth after a troubled exit from Chapecoense. Being behind in the scoresheet, Cruzeiro returned to attacking ways, but not an effective press. Brand new manager, same old disappointments.

The *Esmeraldino* are 3 for 3 in this start of the championship’s final half. The distancing from the relegation zone is sure to bring relief to everyone involved in the club, they’ll continue to fight their place in Brazil’s top tier. While the *Raposa* sinks further in their situation. With holes showing the club’s crisis week in and week out, and now a continued subpar display in the tournament. The relegation danger is starting to get more real by the moment.

416,The Brazilian Série A's managerial musical chairs,"It is way more common than it probably should be. A club hires a new manager, with the premise of starting a new line of work, with new philosophies, and a whole new idea of how the players should play, imposing new tactics and a new mindset. After a promising start, 2 or 3 games, the ""new manager fever"" fades out and the team starts playing in a less acceptable ways. After some bad results, fans start to question the choices and boo both the players and the coach, and the pressure mounts up; the press points out there can only be one more bad game before he gets sacked, and the board is scrutinized for making such a bad choice. Inevitably, the team loses one or two more games, and the oh-so-promising boss leaves by the morning, only 6 months or so after being hires. Was he really that bad a choice? Was he really that bad a fit? Did we really have enough time to judge? Yeah, probably not.  


But this has its own, gigantic dimension in Brazil - where few managers really manage to gather more than a season at each club. And, starting in the beggining of August (that is, barely half a month after the end of Copa America, an 1 month pause to the competition), what we've seen is a ridiculous passing around of managerial jobs - and some shitshows that really show the state of our national football and league - both of which have (hopefully) ended now.  


It starts with an old acquaintance of ours, probably our most known manager for the last 20 or so years. Felipão had been the Palmeiras boss for one whole year (that is a really big feat, sadly), starting July 2018, and won last year's Brasileirão. Before Copa America, they'd been lighting the league on fire again, dominating every opponent, and, after 9 matches, had won 8 and drawn 1, remaining unbeaten, 5 points ahead of Santos, the second placed until that point. However, performance dropped and they went 5 games without a win before he was fired, in the 3rd of September.  


On the other hand (and half of the table), we had Mano Menezes. With a squad that was widely regarded as one of the best in Brazil in the start of the year, and being their boss since July 2016 (the longest in charge in Série A), people had high expectations for Cruzeiro. However, they went on a run of EIGHTEEN GAMES and only one win, until Mano was finally fired, with the Foxes sitting in 18th place, in the relegation zone, in the beginning of August.  


For any reason, Palmeiras decided to sign Mano Menezes, giving him the job to lead them to the title again - even if he'd only been able to win 1 of his last 18 matches. So far, so good, he's been (really surprisingly) doing well, even if still trailing way behind Flamengo. I doubt they'll be able to turn it around, but it'll be a good race until the end.  


That leaves Cruzeiro with an opening for their managerial job. Again, despite the poor record, they still had one of the most highly regarded rosters in the whole Campeonato Brasileiro, so it was a no brainer when Rogério Ceni, who, in his year and a half in charge of Fortaleza, had won their first national title, the Série B (brazilian second tier), and was regarded as a legend already, was offered a job at a bigger club with much bigger perspectives. The fans were a bit mad at this, but it seemed like a big step forward in his career, and he was appointed in 11th August. This led to Fortaleza signing Zé Ricardo, who had been out of a job since April earlier this year.

&amp;#x200B;

That seems to solve it, right? Only it didn't. But we'll come back to this later. For now, we present you with: Fluminense and Sao Paulo.

&amp;#x200B;

The two clubs were clear opposites. On one hand, the carioca club were managed by Fernando Diniz, who was once regarded as the most promising amongst the 'new' managers, but despite making his teams play a really quick, vistous, and beautiful football, hardly ever made a real impact, failing to impress at both Athletico Paranaense and Fluminense. This, however, was often guilted on the fact that he'd never had a strong, complete and competitive roster in his hands, and that ""when he finally had the chance, he'd do it, surely"". Diniz was fired in 19th August. However, Flu's board made an obvious mistake that everyone but them could see, hiring Oswaldo de Oliveira, a choice that was inevitably bound to fail.

On the other, Sao Paulo's board invested really hard this year, building a squad with the likes of Pato, Hernanes, Dani Alves and Juanfran, along with some other signings that really made them one of the strongest squads in the Campeonato, maybe only behind Palmeiras and Flamengo. However, Cuca, the manager who was hired to lead them, despite all his winning, really isn't at the top of his game anymore, and except for a title win with Palmeiras 3 years ago, all his latest work's been pretty bad. The team never managed to take shape and play the way it was expected, eventually lagging behind the dispute, and even some other teams, in the table. He finally left the job (and here I let my bias come through) last Thursday.  


They come together when, despite his last jobs having been really poor, Diniz was rapidly hired by São Paulo, and was finally given the squad he so deserved to train. As of now, he's only played one match, and that is not even hardly time enough for his work to be judged, so we'll let it go for now.

Oswaldo, however, had a really rough time at Fluminense. Hated by the fans from the start, he never really got a chance to impress, no matter how unlikely that would've been, and ended up fired after only THIRTY EIGHT DAYS. THIRTY. EIGHT. But, no matter how ridiculous that is, nothing can be more absurd than the shitshow that caused his dismissal. On the draw between Fluminense and Santos, he asked Ganso (the one and only) to track back, and the midfielder fired back, accusing him of being ""dumb"" and not seeing that he was doing it already. Understandably mad, Oswaldo subbed him off, and Ganso told him he was ""really fucking dumb"", to which he responded that he couldn't play such a lazy-ass player. The argument continued and Ganso finally dethroned Kepa by standing in the edge of the field telling the other players how to position themselves. In the end, they tried to make it seem like nothing really happened and that Oswaldo and Ganso were in good terms; that was hard, however, as the manager ended up fired two days later. They are now without a manager.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me take us back to Cruzeiro, now. After a flying start, getting 7 out of 9 possible points, Ceni's side had been dragged back to the mud after Thiago Neves decided that he'd had enough, and that he was the manager now. After a loss to Internacional in the Copa do Brasil, he gave an interview to the TV network Globo stating that Edilson (a right back) should have played instead of Ceni's choice (he didn't play because both him and the manager felt that his lack of confidence would prejudice the team), and that he'd only let the players know who would play 3 hours before the match - which was promptly denied. The struggle had started. Days later, Cruzeiro lost 4-1 to Grêmio at home, which prompted more comments from Neves on Ceni's choices; and, in the next game, he was benched. For that, Dedé, the captain, and Neves gave a speech in the dressing room, positioning themselves against Rogério Ceni - even if he, as the manager, should have the freedom to choose the team at his will. Ceni left earlier that day, a clear sign that he'd lost control over his players, and that his stint was almost over. The board, as seen at Fluminense, firstly showed him support, only to fire him days later.

Barely a day later, Zé Ricardo was fired from Fortaleza for terrible results, and, surprise surprise, Ceni was announced back, showing the total lack of planning from the club from Ceará, and they were reunited after barely 50 days apart - and, just yesterday, they showed way more composure than they did for the two months, going back to winning ways by beating Botafogo 1-0.

To end things off, Cruzeiro, the team that's been behind the scenes commanding this ridiculous shitshow from start to finish, have just announced Abel Braga, the manager that wasn't able to make a Flamengo team that's now strolling through matches under Jesus play any kind of minimally acceptable football, failing to impress in all of the Campeonato Carioca, the Copa Libertadores, and the Brasileirão; and he'll have the almost impossible mission to rescue a team that's in the hands of selfish players, that don't play how they should nor follow the manager's orders, a board that's been falling apart on behalf of corruption scandals; basically, a team left for dead in the bottom of the table.  


The end? Probably not, truly, I'd expect much, much more to come the following months, as teams start to get desperate to accomplish their goals or just not get relegates. But, for now, that's it. Hope you enjoyed it!",soccer,1569953732,shino50ul,14,72,True,2019-10-01

For premier league clubs (and I’m not just talking about the big 6) it’s incredibly difficult to get tickets even with membership. 

It’s not easy for me and many others to be available for any match they happen to get tickets for, if any, and therefore I cannot justify spending money on a membership if I might not make it to a single match. Why should I pay for the right to have a chance at buying tickets? 

Premier league tickets are expensive as it is. Literally all I’m proposing is that everyone starts from 0 points, rather than getting 100 or whatever it is for paying for membership.",soccer,1569959074,HayekReincarnate,1,3,True,2019-10-01

My question for those familiar with attending these games is which stadiums/fixtures are ones you consider must see?",soccer,1569009294,foxtrotter65,27,0,True,2019-09-20

[](#icon-net-big) **MATCH EVENTS**

1': We're off!

3': Mascarell unwisely tries a shot and scuffs it wide.

13': Save! Burgstaller denied by Zentner! (and also a late flag)

20': Malong scares the keeper with a long-distance shot that curls just wide of the post.

24': Serdar slices a shot high over the goal.

26': Sané flashes a header across face of goal, Burgstaller reaches for it but can't get there.

35': Absolutely terrible shot from Schalke. Not much quality in front of goal today, so far at least.

36': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL SCHALKE!! Finally! A great incisive pass from Harit, *Suat Serdar* has a great first touch and fires on the second! What a goal!**](https://streamja.com/agae)

40': Burgstaller with the overhead kick!! It's so close but goes just wide.

**HT Schalke 04 1-0 Mainz 05** Schalke has the lead and they deserve it too.

-----

46': We're back!

47': [](#icon-yellow) *Weston McKennie* stops a counter with a shoulder tug

53': Serdar's shot goes very high into the sky.

56': McKennie throws himself into a header but doesn't get good contact. Did well to set up the move though.

58': [](#icon-sub) Mainz double sub: *Bote Baku and Alexandru Maxim* on for *Danny Latza and Pierre Malong*

60': [](#icon-sub) Schalke substitution: *Mark Uth* on for *Suat Serdar*

63': Burgstaller demands a penalty! There was a high boot arguably but the ref decides not high enough for a pen.

65': [](#icon-yellow) *Daniel Brosinski* intentionally fouls Caligiuri to stop a counter

67': Nübel gets off his line but fails to punch the ball away, fortunately for him the glancing header goes wide.

71': Fernandes goes for power but doesn't have the placement, puts it too high.

71': [](#icon-sub) Mainz substitution: *Karim Onisiwo* on for *Ádám Szalai*

74': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL MAINZ!! *Karim Onisiwo* levels it in just three minutes of being on the pitch! Schalke loses the ball cheaply in the back and Onisiwo scores an amazing turning shot out of nothing! No chance for Nübel!**](https://streamja.com/97ak)

76': [](#icon-sub) Schalke substitution: *Matija Nastasić* on for *Weston McKennie*

78': Onisiwo tries again but his low shot doesn't trouble Nübel

81': [](#icon-sub) Schalke substitution: *Ahmed Kutucu* on for *Guido Burgstaller*

81': Boëtius fires wide.

84': Baku fires a decent low shot and makes Nübel work for the save.

86': Harit does the one-two with Mascarell and fires hard to the far post but curls it away!

87': Kutucu fires hard at goal but right into Zentner's hands.

89': [](#icon-sub) [**GOAL SCHALKE!!! A late winner surely! *Amine Harit* does it again for Schalke, cutting from the wing to the edge of the box and steers the shot around the defense into the far side!**](https://streamja.com/G7m7)

148,"How would the World Cup, or any football competition change, if at all, if they introduced ""bonus points"".","Having a watch of the Rugby World Cup, and Rugby isn't really my thing so I'm learning a bit, and one of the things they do, at least in the WC is a bonus Table Point for certain things.

There are 2 seperate Bonus Points possible per Match, one with offensive incentive the other is defensive.

Keep in mind they earn more points overall for standard results, but could something like this work in football/soccer?

I think two separate 0.5 points on offer would be interesting it's an edge over another if all 3 results are the same.

Problem with that is that a domination counts as a draw, and I'm not sure that's right.

166,Scout Report [2019-09-21],"Welcome to your thread dedicated to scouting some slightly less well known players. Whether it’s a young
prospect at your club that you want to bring to other’s attention or an older head from a team most won’t
normally watch that you think is the next Jamie Vardy.

For those of you that are unsure how to approach it, here’s a guideline of stuff that you may want to include
(feel free to add or change according to how you see fit though):

**Games watched** - Just a little description of what they’re basing their judgment on Basic info of the player -
age, nationality, height etc.

**Stats** - Games played, goals, whatever and source for things that aren’t basic
like some of the stuff whoscored.com provides. Description of current role within team. What are his
primary responsibilities? What does he allow other players to do?

**Strengths/weaknesses**

**Summary** - Can be where he’s at now, his potential, any discussion about tactical fits etc. If some sort of
grade is included, give a key every time, because it won’t mean the same thing to everybody

This thread is really for players that not everyone will be familiar with, so please try and encourage those
giving insight to players you’ve not heard of before.

336,VAR or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Tech,"VAR is inherently misunderstood. Most of us live in societies that have glamorized technology for the majority of our lives. If you grew up in the 90's, you know how excited we all were by the creation of the internet. In the 2000's, our phones transitioned from being simple calling devices into smart phones capable of solving problems when we were out and about. In the 2010's social media democratized how information was spread and connected us to people across the world. The zeitgeist for the last 30 years has been: technology will improve our lives because technology is good.

Unfortunately, this viewpoint fundamentally misunderstands what technology is - a tool. Some tools are good in certain cases, some tools are bad in certain cases, and some tools carry within them the seeds of our own demise.

Whether it be addiction to the internet, the spreading of disinformation through social media or the spike in anxiety in teenagers - more attention needs to be paid to the downsides of naively embracing technology.

I get it - this is boring, get to the point. But until you grapple with the previous paragraphs, you will disregard everything else I have to say with the constantly repeated, ""Oh well, it is a problem now. But once the technology improves, those problems will go away."" No. The problems are inherent, and technology can not fix some issues.

\*\*Problem #1 - VAR reinforces the idea that sports are fundamentally about who ""rightfully"" wins a game. \*\* It is true that the team that plays more skillfully should win most of the time. But sports catches our imagination in part because it reflects the nature of life. Sometimes we catch a lucky break. Sometimes something unexpected happens. Bill Gates didn't become so rich just because he was smart - he became that rich because he was in the right place at the right time. If the anti-trust regulators had been a little more aggressive in the 90's, Microsoft wouldn't have taken off in the way it did. Real life is not about who is scientifically ""the best"". Real life is messy, and sports are too. Take that away and games just become tests.

\*\*Problem #2 - Many rules of the game are inherently subjective, not objective \*\* The line between a foul, and a yellow card and a red card are constantly debated. If you watch professional level players discussing a call, you can frequently have multiple, intelligent, informed people come to different conclusions. There is often no right answer. This becomes especially more problematic when every individual decision is robbed of its context within the spirit of the game. If a player makes a dirty tackle, but it was clearly done as a pattern of dirty tackles then it should be given as a yellow card. You can't isolate a single tackle and say ""This tackle deserves a red or yellow"". There are other factors, like the history between players and within a game. 

\*\*Problem #3 - ""A clear and obvious error"" is also inherently subjective\*\* This one doesn't need much explanation. Whereas one person may think ""Oh, him being 3 mm offsides is very clear"" another person may say that is within the realm of ""not a clear error"". 

\*\*Problem #4 - Events viewed in slow motion appear different than events viewed in real time \*\* Tackles look meaner, hand balls looks more intentional. 

\*\*Problem #5 - It introduces a significant amount of delay in knowing what the current state of the game is \*\* You may think your team has scored a goal, but maybe you didn't? Maybe it will be overturned? Rather than trust your own two eyes and getting to be in the moment you instead have to wait for a group of people to tell you what is happening. It sucks as a fan

\*\*Problem #6 - The videos are analyzed by referees, who will make mistakes of their own\*\* The technology doesn't replace human error, it just translates the human error to a different group of humans.

\*\*Problem #7 - It is unclear how far ""back in time"" that VAR should go to right a wrong. \*\* If there was a missed foul by an attacking player 3 seconds before a goal, it seems clear that goal should be overturned. But what about 10 seconds? What about 30 seconds? What if there was a bad call on the tackle which turned over the ball, which leads to a string of 50 passes and a goal? 

I am sure there are more issues, but those are the most obvious ones I see. We all say, ""Oh we have to do this because technology is better and we don't want unfair things to happen to teams."" But I regret to inform you - Unfair things will continue to happen to teams until the end of time. That is life. And that is sports. Embrace it, for the health of the game.",soccer,1569079041,Wilhelm_IV,52,47,True,2019-09-21

387,Revolutionary proposal: Pundits should rate players on a scale up to 11 instead of 10,"The fact is, no one thinks of a player getting a rating of five as being average. It's what they get when they've been alright, but a bit anonymous or had a couple of minor f\*\*\* ups that didn't matter. Also, no one ever really gets zero, unless they've been Moussa Sissoko in his first season with us. 

Six is really the 'Okay' rating, but that only leaves room for four better grades, which can be difficult if there have been a number of outstanding performances.

So we should accept that six is the *meh* performance and add a big man up top. Those truly exceptional MOTM performances by a player can earn a score of eleven, Spinal Tap style.

Let's march on Westminster to demand that this immediately be mandated by law.

##[](#sprite1-p90) Corinthians [2x2](https://youtu.be/Az5_oAMhB6c) Ceará [](#sprite4-p346)
[](#icon-ball) *23’: João Lucas (COR/OG); 37’: Vágner Love (COR); 59’: Thiago Galhardo (CEA); 90’+1: Leandro Carvalho (CEA).*

**With four goals on one side of the pitch, Corinthians and Ceará split halves.**

*Timão* capitalized on their recent good run and won their last round match against Atlético Mineiro, while *Vozão* were on opposite form which was only made worse after their loss to Athletico Paranaense in Brasileirão’s previous round. Due to international call-ups, Corinthians lost 2 crucial players, but you know just things that happen (quite frequently) in Brazilian footy. The match was quite even for most of the first half, but started to crumble for Ceará after a defender’s blunder. To top it off for the hosts, they managed to increase their advantage still on the first 45. Coming back to the second 45, *Timão* looked kinda off. This gave space for the visitors to grow in the game. After a rather quick goal to pluck one back in, *Vozão* started to constantly press the home team, with a couple of dangerous shots making their keeper work. By the end, the equalizer couldn’t be more deserved. Grabbing a point for his team, an absolute belter by attacker Leandro Carvalho, such a beautiful Olympic goal. Disappointing end to a Saturday morning for the *corinthianos*, as the gap between them and top of the table grew to 7 points. A momentary break to their optimistic aspirations, huh. This miraculous draw can be the spark that ignites a change in mood for the *cearenses* 一 not for the literal point gained, but from an emotional perspective. The team is now certainly feeling more light after breaking that 3-loss streak.

Both teams only return to action for the Brasileirão’s 19^th round.

##[](#sprite1-p265) Vasco da Gama [0x2](https://youtu.be/Dtr9maPixV0) Bahia [](#sprite2-p480)
[](#icon-ball) *55’: Nino Paraíba (BAH); 60’: Gilberto (BAH).*

**Despite a packed São Januário, Vasco da Gama losses to Bahia.**

Both clubs had a simple 1x0 in their respective last round encounters, BUT. Vasco were on the short end of the stick and lost to Cruzeiro, whereas Bahia defeated CSA. Both clubs went forward with what were best, and available, for them. Following a trend on their home games, *Gigante da Colina* held possession and looked to assert dominance on their turf. However this style fits *Esquadrão de Aço*’s plan of a strong defensive system and lethal counters. The first half was evenly split, with this outline in mind. But in response to the lack of meaningful chances on the first 45, the hosts started to draw themselves forward, leaving crucial spaces at the back. This went in favour of the visitors, who scored twice in the last 45 minutes. To add insult to injury, another instance of the *Lei do Ex*™ in this Brasileirão: striker Gilberto scored a golazo against (one of) his former teams. Accompanying the somber defeat, coach Luxemburgo had some thinking to do. The *cariocas* who were once looking at the top half of the table, now return to their momentaneous reality: dangerously close to the relegation spots. A stark contrast to the *baianos*’ optimism after a sensational (almost) first half of the championship, the fans are delighted with the push for a long awaited continental qualification. Hopefully they manage to keep their great run of form going.

The two teams don’t have any other match scheduled besides their next match in the Campeonato Brasileiro.

##[](#sprite5-p7) Fortaleza [0x1](https://youtu.be/HhWeeOlg3gc) Fluminense [](#sprite1-p228)
[](#icon-ball) *85’: João Pedro (FLU).*

**Fortaleza gets blocked by great goalkeeping, and Fluminense run away with the win.**

On the previous round, *Leão* defeated fellow Série B promoted side Goiás. Considering this win and the back-to-back matches in the Castelão, Fortaleza were optimistic for another positive result against a crisis-stricken Fluminense. To pile on their misery, *Time de Guerreiros* managed the impossible in their last Brasileirão outing and lost at home to Avaí. Looking to capitalize on the shaken state of the visitors, the hosts started the game attacking viciously. Which brings up one of the major points of the match, keeper Muriel (Brazil’s keeper Alisson brother!) superb performance for Flu. Foralza kept trying to open up the score, with the opponents shutting up shop and looking for a couple of counters. Come the second half and *Leão* made forward thinking subs, still trying to take advantage of their good record at home. Unfortunately for them, Nense’s goalie made save after save. To top it off, on one of the few instances of Fluminense going forward, wonderkid João Pedro got the match’s sole goal. A bucket full of cold water straight into the head of every Fortaleza fan... The hosts know they dropped the ball and wasted a major opportunity to further themselves away from relegation contention, it’ll be a long week of anxiety for everyone involved. The difference in points between them and the first on the Z4 has now diminished to 6, and could become lesser during this midweek… On the other side of the ring, the visitors left the stadium with hope renewed for the foreseeable future. If they manage to win their postponed match, the club will get out of the relegation spots after 3 consecutive rounds in the no-no zone.

The northeasterners will have a week to cope after the disappointing defeat. While the southeasterners are going to face Palmeiras during this midweek, for a delayed 16^th round match. 

##[](#sprite2-p373) Avaí [0x3](https://youtu.be/rp_bTWMDQQU) Flamengo [](#sprite1-p100)
[](#icon-ball) *11’: Gabriel Barbosa (FLA); 31’: Pablo Marí (FLA); 52’: Reinier (FLA).*

**Who would’ve guessed, Avaí get slammed and jammed by Flamengo.**

IT HAPPENED, AVAÍ WON A BRASILEIRÃO MATCH. ANY MATCH ACTUALLY, THEY HAD BEING ENDURING A PRETTY LONG WINLESS STREAK 一 19 matches, to be precise. Anyhow, the team won their previous round outing against Fluminense and sparkled joy into a rather bleak atmosphere on the club at the moment. Unfortunately for the hosts, they faced the league leaders. Flamengo arrived for the 18^th round match after a triumphant win against Palmeiras in the 17^th round. Despite being credited as the home team, *Leão da Ilha* hosted the match in Brasília [(just a couple of km away from their lair in Florianópolis)](https://i.ibb.co/DRKS5Rg/image.png), at the [Mané Garrincha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est%C3%A1dio_Nacional_Man%C3%A9_Garrincha). Yes, another instance of a club selling their home court advantage in order to cash in against the country’s most followed team. Not really a surprise, kinda like what followed in the 90 minutes. *Mengão* dominated thoroughly the match, with a great first half and a solid second one. A special nod to midfielder Gerson’s performance, a mid-season signing who has fit perfectly in Flamengo’s new manager tactic. I mean, there’s not really anything worth of note for Avaí, the club was 100% outclassed and it was clearly shown. At least they got some money off of it, will see how this harsh defeat sits with them come next match. Well, kind of expected, wasn’t it? Probably the most unlucky part of the *avaianos*’ weekend came in the victories of fellow relegation candidates, leaving they 4 points away from the 19^th place team. Also kinda expected for the *flamenguistas*, who continue on their cruise for the league, a massive streak of great result after great result. They now open a 2-points window between them and 2^nd place.

Yeah, no match during the middle of this week for none of the two clubs. 

##[](#sprite1-p190) Internacional [1x0](https://youtu.be/Y3VM_Pd2WJI) São Paulo [](#sprite1-p101)
[](#icon-ball) *76’: Rafael Sóbis (INT).*

**Internacional defeat São Paulo in unexpectedly even game.**

Internacional won their previous match for the Brasileirão, a resounding win against Botafogo. While São Paulo faced Grêmio in their last match for the league, a frustrating draw considering the visiting team’s lineup. Before playing for the Campeonato Brasileiro, *Colorado* had a most important semifinal second leg against Cruzeiro in the Copa do Brasil. Not only they got through to the final after almost 10 years away from it, they also [thumped their opposition while getting there](https://youtu.be/wtmhttXuEjE). With the final in mind, only 3 first teamers started the match. On the *Soberano* side, they lost 2 vital players due to international call-ups, but otherwise fielded what was best and available. Following the expectations, São Paulo were on top of Inter’s reserves during the first half, with some dangerous chances to open the score. Whoever this changed come the second half, manager Odair provided some subs to replenish the hosts’ breath. The match shifted in *Colorado*’s favour as they started to create more than the visitors. *Tricolor Paulista* tried to respond, but couldn’t quite get there. The match’s one and only goal came from a VAR penalty, a hand ball by head turner defensive midfielder Hudson. The hosts’ win despite fielding an alternative lineup couldn’t be more aptly described than superb. They now fire on all cylinders, going strong for a Libertadores qualification on the Brasileirão and a historic 2^nd Copa do Brasil title. As for the visitors… In the same vein as their unexpected postulation for title contention 一 which came out of absolutely nowhere 一, they’re now returning to their early expectations of a solid championship and a Libertadores 2020 spot.

The *gaúchos* will travel to Curitiba for the first leg of the Copa do Brasil final, they’ll battle Athletico Paranaense for the trophy in the upcoming weeks. Things don’t look as bright for the *paulistas*, who’ll probably check out the game from the telly as their next match is only a week away, valid for the Brasileirão’s 19^th round.

##[](#sprite2-p340) Goiás [1x2](https://youtu.be/8-d6mhLdtDk) Palmeiras [](#sprite1-p142)
[](#icon-ball) *20’: Rafael Vaz (GOI); 80’: Willian (PAL); 90’+8: Gustavo Scarpa (PAL).*

**Goiás’ wonderstrike couldn’t help them from losing to Palmeiras.**

The hosts returned home after a defeat to Fortaleza where they fell victim to Murphy’s law. While the visitors went to Goiânia coming from a humiliating loss against Flamengo, which resulted in the sacking of their former manager. This was the debut for the new face on the sidelines, experienced manager [Mano Menezes](https://twitter.com/Palmeiras/status/1169681459046682624). Both clubs fielded their best XI available. The first half presented us a pleasant surprise: a torpedo, a balazo, a belter, a magnificent long range strike by centre-back Rafael Vaz. Following this golazo, Goiás retracted into their part of the field and started to park the bus. Palmeiras were unsuccessful during the first half, with a correctly invalidated goal. Come the second half and things went in the direction of *Esmeraldino*’s current phase: A Series of Unfortunate Events. After a bashing of heads, keeper Tadeu and midfielder Zé Rafael both had to be subbed out. [Tadeu was the first to go to a hospital](https://imgur.com/T5HEW0P), as he passed out right after the clash, later Zé Rafael also received medical attention. With a sub goalkeeper, things started to look dire for Goiás’ ambitions of holding a result. Their luck also saw a *Porco*’s goal being called offside, but then validated through VAR help. The visitors kept going at the hosts, throwing men forward to get the comeback win. One of Palmeiras’ subs, attacking mid Lucas Lima managed to get sent off with cards coming in an interval of 3 minutes, the absolute legend. But as we’re talking about the *goianos*’ luck, they saw the *paulistas* getting a super late goal to peg them the win, even a man down and creating the chance through a long throw. Jeez. Despite the wondergoal, *Esmeraldino* continue to get struck by Murphy’s law… They’re only a few points away from the relegation zone. Once a surprise on the top half of the table, the *goianos* can now peak at the abyss. But talking about the other green team, *Porco* are starting to rejuvenate their ambitions after the horrid dry spell on this past weeks. Maybe the *paulistas* can still battle for their 10^th Brasileirão title after all.

Goiás will sit the week out, coming back to action for the Brasileiro’s next round. On the other hand, Palmeiras will play their delayed encounter with Fluminense, for the tournament’s 16^th round.

##[](#sprite1-p196) Cruzeiro [1x4](https://youtu.be/0bWRKlXVxnU) Grêmio [](#sprite1-p130)
[](#icon-ball) *18’: Diego Tardelli (GRE); 27’: Alisson (GRE); 36’: Fred (CRU); 63’: Everton (GRE); 76’: Everton (GRE).*

**Cruzeiro’s crisis gets worse after thrashing by Grêmio.**

The *cruzeirenses* arrived home after their horrid elimination in the Copa do Brasil semifinals, they [got smacked](https://youtu.be/wtmhttXuEjE) by Internacional on both legs. While the *gremistas* had a nice little week to [rest](https://youtu.be/bwMrap31MAo), [heh](https://i.ibb.co/CVwpVxx/image.png). On their respective last round affairs, Cruzeiro got a solid win against Vasco, and Grêmio managed to draw with São Paulo. Both teams fielded some of their best players available, probably to give an immediate response to being knocked out of the national cup so close to the final. The first half presented a game kind of even during the initial moments, but then the visitors started to stake their claim on the match. With two goals before the 30 minute mark, *Imortal* forced the *Raposa*’s manager to make an offensive sub still on the first half. The hosts pegged back one goal from a penalty kick, but that was it for the first 45. Come the second half and morale throughout the Cruzeiro squad seemed to sink deeper. Brazil’s best player (don’t @ me) Everton Cebolinha did what he does best and scored two beauties to seal the deal for Grêmio. The supporters who woke up early to see their team play didn’t fancy taking 4 goals into their net, proceeded to [shout their lungs out and throw popcorn at the players during a technical break](https://twitter.com/radioitatiaia/status/1170725668629467142) 一 right after the 4^th goal too, oof. The slip up cost dearly to *Raposa*. Not only the crisis going on at the club flashed to the public, but the team is now a step closer to relegation battle mid-season despair. If you don’t buy into the turmoil going on at the club, the day after this game [a part of the fans had some things on their mind that they wanted to share](https://imgur.com/FQOLVqG). On the other hand, the bounceback couldn't have been better for *Imortal*. The southerners provided an immediate response to the lacklustre midweek performance, and to top it off gave the fans a sliver of hope in the battle for Libertadores 2020 qualification.

Both teams will sit at home and watch the ones who beat them face off in the Copa do Brasil finals... Yeah, and they’ll return to action for the Brasileirão’s 19^th round.

##[](#sprite1-p187) Santos [1x1](https://youtu.be/wfCj6-WMWBE) Athletico Paranaense [](#sprite1-p443)
[](#icon-ball) *41’: Braian Romero (CAP); 90’+1: Carlos Sánchez (SAN).*

**Amidst questionable decisions, Santos disappoints against Athletico Paranaense’s reserves.**

*Peixe* returned home winners after a tough match against Chapecoense. While *Fhuracão* put an end to their questionable run of results with a simple win against Ceará. But before returning to Brasileirão action, Athletico played their home leg on the Copa do Brasil semifinal clash. The team managed to [equalize the aggregate score and then win the deciding penalty shootout](https://youtu.be/bwMrap31MAo) against Grêmio. In order to rest their key players for the incoming cup final, they fielded pretty much a fully rotated XI. This would open up for an easy win for the hosts, who fielded their best players apt for the match (a couple were on international duty). Despite the expected advantage in terms of personnel, the visitors proved hard to beat. *Santástico* didn’t create much of dangerous chances in the first half, and to top it off saw CAHP pull ahead on the scoresheet. The visiting team were clearly trying to nullify any kind of football-playing schtick during moments of the first 45 and throughout all of the remaining 45. The home team were better in the last half, but at the same time were ineffective enough to not pluck one in. Their fortunes changed after a questionable foul was called for Santos, a strange duel between winger Marinho and Argentine winger Braian Romero. To make things weird, VAR called the ref to take a peek at something in the monitor. The result was a penalty call, right out of thin air. That chance was converted by the benefited team, making Athletico feel undone by the refereeing. The late draw couldn’t salvage Santos’ 1^st place battle, and they’re now looking at a 2-points deficit between them and the new sole league leaders. Getting bullshited by a late equalizer certainly must taste bittersweet for Athletico, but the truth is they only have eyes for that crucial Copa do Brasil final.

The *santistas* will have a week to rest and pick themselves up for another go at the Brasileirão. While the *athleticanos* have a match before returning to league action, it’s the first leg of the Copa do Brasil finals. They’ll host Internacional on Wednesday, starting their two-legged clash.

**Botafogo shoo away their ghosts and beat Atlético Mineiro.**

After a somber defeat to Internacional in the last round, Botafogo returned home with a calling out for fans to support them in these hard times. And to face them were Atlético Mineiro, who lost once again in the Brasileirão but this time to Corinthians. Both teams fielded their best players available. The first half didn’t bring many highlights for a majority of the time, but then VAR Ex Machina happened. On top of giving the hosts a penalty, the ref also sent off visitors’ centre-back Igor Rabello after a hand ball. *Fogão* left the first 45 with a slim advantage on the scoresheet, as *Galo* had to endure being a man down for the last half. With no shame in their decision, Botafogo retracted to their side of the pitch and looked for counters. Against a 10-man team. Yes. They eventually got another goal to bring relief to every fan in the stands. To close off the match, Atlético managed to pluck one back, but so late in the game that didn’t really influence much. Two sides on this 6-points game. First, the *cariocas*’. During the start of the league season, Botafogo were poised as one of the teams to battle against relegation, but so far have defied these expectations and sit comfortably on the top half. Second, the *mineiros*’. For brief stints, they looked like a contender for the title, however the current run of results may have spoiled even the most optimistic fan’s dreams. We’ll have to see if Atlético will turn their focus on the Copa Sulamericana trophy.

You guessed it, Botafogo and Atlético Mineiro won’t play during the middle of this week.

[](#icon-ball) *40’: Alecsandro (CSA); 90’+3: Jonatan Gómez (CSA).*

**CSA get an important win in a 6-points match against Chapecoense.**

CSA took the travelling back home for some thought, especially after the slim defeat to Bahia in the last round. Chapecoense went north thinking the same after their slim defeat in the previous Brasileirão round, however against Santos. The teams fielded their best XI, looking to get into a better position on the race against relegation. Before talking about the game, I feel it’s nice to highlight [this banner](https://twitter.com/ChapecoenseReal/status/1170817944160485377) brought by the players from Chape and CSA. They’ve come forward in support of the families who haven’t got their reinvidications from the companies involved in the 2016 tragedy. The match was marked by a couple of key moments, much like missed penalties, invalidated goals, and red cards. A real show by the two. The hosts managed to score once in the first half, even though having two goals rightfully disallowed and a missed penalty… In the last half, the visitors got a penalty call and a nice chance to level the score, but stopped at the opposition keeper’s hands. To add to the horrid game from the *catarinenses*, defensive midfielder Márcio Araújo and centre-back Gum were sent off during the course of the second half. To close out the match, the *alagoanos* scored a goal in the final minutes of play. Despite the horror show of occurrences, *Azulão* certainly have a lot to cherish. They’ve never been so close to getting out of the relegation zone, hopefully the club can keep walking in this direction. Unfortunately, things don’t look as bright for *Verdão do Oeste*. As their opponents rose on the table, they sunk into the league’s penultimate place.

Neither CSA nor Chapecoense have matches scheduled before their next outing for the Brasileirão.

220,League Roundup: Ten countries were eliminated from World Cup qualification today. 190 countries remaining.,"*I'm making an ongoing series where I make a post every time a country is eliminated from qualification in an ""And There Were None"" countdown to the World Cup.*

today the final batch of the 2nd legs of the first round of African qualifying eliminated 10 countries.

Eliminated:

### [](#sprite6-p159) Somalia

After Somalia managed to win 1-0 in their ""home"" leg in Djibouti with a cross-header goal, Zimbabwe came back in their home leg to win 3-1, with goals coming from Marshall Munetsi of Reims (on a bicycle kick) and Admiral Muskwe of Leicester City (on a free kick), eliminating Somalia with a 3-2 aggregate.

[First leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtRio8eZEIA)

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-E2Ah_HGjQ)

### [](#sprite6-p55) Eritrea

After going down 2-0 at home (one of which was an own goal), Eritrea managed to keep it close by getting one. But their glimpse of hope didn't last as they remained scoreless in their away leg, ending 4-1 on aggregate against Namibia.

[First leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-flcPMfZbk)

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpOIP9xMmNQ)

### [](#sprite6-p165) Eswatini

In Djibouti, the home team scored two goals, one a penalty and the other a rebound off a penalty save. Eswatini managed to leave the game down 2-1, but couldn't manage better than a scoreless draw at home, getting eliminated on a 2-1 aggregate.

[First leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQpZhkaBYJk)

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q45X2OrbLtM)

### [](#sprite6-p23) Botswana

Despite several near-misses, saves, and hits to the posts from both teams, the score between Botswana and Malawi was a goalless draw until the 81st minute of the 2nd leg, when a penalty awarded to Malawi became the sole decider of this round, eliminating Botswana.

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUdU994p_4w)

### [](#sprite6-p62) Gambia

Despite ample scoring chances, Gambia went down 0-1 against Angola, and then fell behind again 0-1 in their away leg. They very briefly managed to equalize with a goal from Zurich's Assan Ceesay, but just three minutes later Fabio Abreu of Moreirense put the final nail in the coffin as Gambia went down 3-1 on aggregate.

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zolJF_cWNQ)

### [](#sprite6-p111) Mauritius

The island nation's World Cup campaign comes and goes without a goal. They failed to equalize after going down 1-0 early in their home leg against Mozambique, and another early goal and a late penalty in their away leg resulted in a 3-0 loss on aggregate.

[First leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJmKE-mdzd4)

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV6I_nU-PlY)

### [](#sprite6-p149) São Tomé and Príncipe

The best Sao Tome could do in their home game was survive several close calls against Guinea-Bissau, holding them to a goalless draw until the 85th minute, when a questionable penalty was taken by Nanu of Maritimo. However, Sao Tome managed to equalize the aggregate with an early goal in Guinea-Bissau off a rebound from a free kick save. The draw held for 54 minutes until Joseph Mendes of Ajaccio scored a brace to send his country to the next round on a 3-1 aggregate.

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6kJXAKueWU)

### [](#sprite6-p38) Comoros

Comoros managed to come back from a 1-0 deficit at home against Togo with a setpiece goal, but the only goal they managed to score on their trip to Togo was an own goal in the tenth minute. This held until Togo managed to finally break in with a goal of their own in the 71st minute, winning 3-1 on aggregate.

[First leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq6A4LERv8E)

[Second leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwzT2i_ZNo)

### [](#sprite6-p34) Chad

In Chad's home leg, Sudan's Ramadan Agab scored an unanswered hat trick (one from open play, one from a botched goal kick, and one off a save rebound). The hosts almost managed to equalize when down by 1, but hit the post. Sudan then parked the bus in their home leg to a 0-0 draw, eliminating Chad on a 3-1 aggregate.

[First leg highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lWFhOl8McY)

### [](#sprite6-p153) Seychelles

It was really not a good day in the Indian Ocean for soccer. Seychelles also goes in and out of their World Cup campaign without a goal, going down 3-0 in their home game and then really being put to the sword 7-0 in Rwanda.

470,What could brands do to help Racism in football?,"Was talking to a mate about the increase, at least in visibility, of racism in football outside of the stadiums themselves. Twitter obviously has been a massive problem and players are helping to highlight it. 

Clubs aren't doing or can't seem to do enough. 

Boards have a lack of diversity in the first place so it seems like it's going to fall on consumer brands to change perception in and out of the stadiums.

Drastic Example: Nike pulls all sponsorship deals on any team that gets in the news with fans/racism. 

But what else could brands do? The beautiful game is being ruined by repulsive moments.",soccer,1568217246,ReheatedBurgerking,17,0,True,2019-09-11

1': We're off!

5': SAVE! Great shot by Salah but Pope keeps it out at the near side!

19': McNeil's shot takes a deflection that takes the sting out of it, safely into the keeper's hands

21': Great chance for Liverpool! Henderson makes a wonderful through pass to Salah, Salah and Pope both go for it and the ball pinballs between them and out just wide!

33': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL LIVERPOOL!! Trent Alexander-Arnold loops a ball over the keeper from distance, and curls beautifully into the top corner! Nothing Pope can do about it! Could it have been intentional?! No, on replay it's going to be an own goal from *Chris Wood* who deflected it in, but gorgeous all the same.**](https://streamvi.com/watch.php?video=1567270987)

37': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL LIVERPOOL!! A terrible mistake from Ben Mee gives the ball straight to Firmino! Liverpool immediately hit the counter and it comes out to *Sadio Mané* who wastes no time finishing into the far side!**](https://streamvi.com/watch.php?video=1567271224)

43': Chance for Barnes but he doesn't hit the target.

45': Barnes with another chance, he drags it wide.

**HT Burnley 0-2 Liverpool** Liverpool continuing their outstanding form in the first half.

46': We're back!

58': Salah fires from wide and hits the side netting.

71': [](#icon-sub) Liverpool substitution: *Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain* on for *Jordan Henderson*

71': Van Dijk lets it fly from distance and puts it way over.

73': [](#icon-sub) Burnley substitution: *Jay Rodriguez* on for *Ashley Barnes*

73': Tarkowski gets a chance but his header goes over.

76': Good save by Adrián but Rodriguez was offside anyway.

79': Oxlade-Chamberlain has a go, but right at Pope.

80': [](#icon-ball-big) [**GOAL LIVERPOOL!! The speed of the counter-attack!! Salah lays it off to *Roberto Firmino* who tucks it into the goal from the edge of the box!**](https://streamvi.com/watch.php?video=1567274779)

85': [](#icon-sub) Liverpool double sub: *Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri* on for *Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané*

89': Oh man, great double save by Adrián off his line, it looked like Rodriguez would surely dribble around the keeper after the first save but he somehow kept out the second as well.

90+1': Great pass from Salah to Wijnaldum, all he has to do is round the keeper but Pope somehow claws the ball away from him.

484,Antwerp's Lamkel Zé (infamous after second red card for Antwerp vs AZ in EL) banned for match vs Zulte Waregem after fight with Bolat,"Lamkel Zé, Antwerp's genious yet infamous midfielder/attacker, has been banned from the team for the upcoming match versus Zulte Waregem after he started a fight with goalkeeper Bolat after a verbal exchange between the two.

This is not Lamkel Zé's first time he's been temporarily banned from the team, but this time could cost him dearly with Antwerp having bought new attackers recently.

In the EL Lamkel Zé played a major role by scoring the 1-0 vs AZ Alkmaar in the 73th minute (which would have secured Antwerp the EL spot) but subsequently after that receiving a second yellow card, thus red and a sentoff, after Mbokani already was sent off in the 35th minute.

488,Walter Mazzarri's Torinese Renaissance,"[**Walter Mazzarri**](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10a9a3eabebb14a9c4797948976db8493ea6dc8b/0_45_2005_1203/master/2005.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5a7a4661af7d1907cc7d8c0664ab0686) has been through a tough period in his coaching career. Mazzarri took a long break from coaching after a bad spell at Inter. After his break, he took a very interesting job at Watford, but this ended with him becoming a hated man in Watford. Walter Mazzarri wouldn't give up and would take a very difficult job at Torino and took the challenge to an elite level.

![img](7o9nqvcxgzj31 ""Mazzarri reputation at Watford"")

Torino’s squad isn’t exceptional on paper, but Mazarri surprised many taking them to European competition. Torino was finding themselves in Europa League zone and engaged in a tight fight with more equipped teams, such as Milan and Rome, or with a more well-grounded technical projects, like Atalanta and Lazio. Il Toro (The Bulls) were the revelations of last season’s Serie A; this was thanks to their model and incredibly well-structured system under Walter Mazzarri

![img](op3tdvd2hzj31 ""The Conductor"")

Mazzarri has implemented tactics from Conte and Capello to get the best out of their team. The key to the system is aggressivity when not having the ball in all departments of the pitch. Walter Mazzarri,  aka ""The Conductor,"" has found the way of playing that gets the best out of his players. This way doesn't need firm profiles, which he needed when coaching Napoli and Inter. The standard formation starts in classic Conte way from the three-man defence, but then it fluctuates between 3-5-2, 3-4-3 or 3-4-2-1; this is mostly due to which players are available and which opponent they are meeting. This is why they are extremely flexible to the right situation in classic Capello way. In addition to the three-man defence, Mazzari has Torino using a man-marking system in the areas they want to be aggressive. Mazzarri would also ask his central defenders to cover the opponents ́ strikers and even sometimes the midfielder, and they will always pressure on switches.

![img](2qyv7d3ahzj31 ""Showcast of their three man defence"")

Mazzarri has found his ideal eleven: Sirigu, Izzo, N’Koulou, Bremer; De Silverstri, Meité, Rincon, Baselli, Ansaldi, Belotti, and Zaza.

![img](hfi33l9njzj31)

Torino was one of the best defences in Serie A last season with a three-man defence. When utilizing 3 at the back, your defenders have to be really aggressive players to maintain the cascading effect. The defenders, thanks to the coverage guaranteed by their teammates, are able to follow their opponents -  even beyond the midfield line. Torino is one of the most aggressive teams in Europe and makes it really complicated to move forward on the pitch for the opponent. Is very important for Torino to win most long ball duels, so they that make the offence work. From the start of the last season, Torino is among the most effective teams in ball recovery, this trend would continue for the rest of the season. This meant that Torino was third place in Serie A for interceptions per game (12), behind only Atalanta and Chievo. This new play translates into the new image of the squad (the importance of the central defenders and their non stop pressing). Torino is third in league in ball recovered in the opposing half of the pitch, with 23.77 recoveries per game, is behind only Atalanta and Napoli. (the stats are from last season)

![img](vlv5lo4wjzj31 "" Torino players pressing the opponent´s back line."")

Mazzarri's team is a very disciplined one way throughout all phases of the game, but special credit should be given to some players on the team. Firstly, one of the most important players for Torino is Armando Izzo. He had an excellent season in 2018 and has exalted himself within the role of the the ball-playing centre back. (In some ways, Gasperini's Genoa should have some credit for introducing Izzo as a center back in Serie A). Izzo is playing as a right center back in the three-man defence. He has an explosive way of marking, which makes it difficult for attackers to receive the ball without losing it. He often manages to appear between opponent and ball to get the ball away from danger. His physicality is not his biggest strength, instead he prefers efficiency in the tackle.

![img](d9bk52a3kzj31 ""Izzo the warrior of Turin. Top 10 defender?"")

Rincon is also very important from a defensive point of view, revitalized after his Juventus experience and returned to his normal playing level that he had shown with Genoa. Ola Aina, Ansaldi and De Silvestri are full of aggression, but also full of stamina. The characteristics of the individuals, united with Mazzarri’s organization, make Torino a team capable of adopting an attitude that makes them competitive against the top in Serie A. Thanks to all these aspects, Torino has the third-best defense of the Serie A (without counting penalties) for conceded goals (27), but against a number of xG was on 40.06. This overperformance in terms of goals actually conceded is among the highest in Serie A after Parma. In the case, is they are lucky that Salvatore Sirigu is in the goal, as this was his best season to date. The explosiveness and elasticity showed by Sirigu between the posts, and his calmness with the ball at his feet led to Torino keping 15 clean sheets.

![img](yanobe99kzj31 ""The most important player for Torino, Sirigu."")

While Torino is an elite and defensive team, their attacking prowess remains rather pragmatic, with very little positional elasticity. They rely heavily on second balls, set pieces, cross. The first thing that stands out from watching the offensive phrase of Mazzarri's team is the difficulty in transforming the many ball recoveries into clear scoring chances. Torino is the best in the league at recovering the ball on the opposing half of the pitch. But, once they regain the ball, Torino doesn't hit the opposing defence while it is disorganized, and they often prefer the safest pass to secure the possession instead of launching into a quick counter attack. This, on the one hand, makes Torino less exposed to counter-pressing opponents, but on the negative side this approach limits their offensive danger. Overall, they are such an aggressive and vertical team without the ball, which is a fairly viaible thing that works for Torino and Mazzarri.

An example of a successful situation after a ball recovering. In this situation Rincon intercepts and Meité getting by 3 opponents just to pass to Berenguer, who pass it wide to De Silvestri. In this case, is the box invaded by Belotti to make life complicated for Sampdoria ́s defence. The goal is, however, very difficult, but in this case did Torino managed to quickly exploit one of its strengths, and Belotti than heads it in against Sampdoria.

![video](8k1os72ckzj31)

This season, it will be interesting to watch how good Mazzarri ́s Torino will be. This could be the season where they can get into the top 5, but they also playing for too many draws. This happens because of their ineffective attack. They have taken out creativity on the midfield by using their main creator to be a defender in Izzo. Mazzarri doesn’t yet have the superstars to compete with the elite in Serie A, but he is constantly over performing; he will probably get another big European job if he continues being successful for Torino.

Bury by tomorrow as it stands. Take a guess at who is responsible. The owners, Steve Dale of Bury and Bassini of Bolton (I refuse to type out his full name. Fuck that cunt.) Two great Manchester clubs. On the verge of extinction. Bury have won two FA Cups in their history. Bolton have won four. They are forever a part of English football history, and now two immoral men and the failure of the EFL's vetting process have jeopardized all of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, if you can help out the two clubs, please do it. I have no great ties to either team but we cannot in good conscience allow this to happen over and over to clubs. Blackpool, Leyton Orient, Hartlepool, and that's just the recent ones. We can't let this keep happening to teams, and we can't support the EFL for their incompetence and bullshittery. That brings up my other point.

&amp;#x200B;

We all love the Premier League. I get it. Sexy Football, Top Players and Managers, big money on the line. But you have tons of local football clubs in your area, and they all need money too. By going and watching these teams and helping your local economy, you can hopefully one day make these clubs self-sufficient. And then we won't need to worry about Dale or Bassini, they'll be relics of an old era. I have my local team, Yeovil Town, now non-league thanks to the incompetence of owners. But I also have Westland Sports Football Club, a team playing in the Dorset Premier League. And they aren't half bad! If I want to go even deeper, there is the Yeovil and District League, which is about level 15 on the Football Pyramid, and the level of play is not exactly the stuff of legends. But sometimes its just nice to get out. The point being, you have clubs all over you're area that need your help.

A way of lessening the impact on the smaller clubs would be the use of opening and closing championships. The opening championship would be each national league playing separately, while the closing championship would be the top clubs from each national league participating in a merged league. The remainder of the teams in each league would continue separately in their own closing championships.

In many cases this format would require leagues to reduce the number of teams to 10-12. To lessen the impact on the clubs not making the cut, I propose mid-season promotion-relegation between the opening and closing championships.

As for European qualification, the opening championship will be used, so the merged league will not result in the loss of CL &amp; EL places.

375,Lithuanian football is dying. What's the football situation like in your country?,"The pathetic situation of the Beautiful Game in my home country got me curious about what it's like to be a fan of the sport in other countries. I don't actively follow the development of football in all nations, but I'd be curious to hear about that! Especially considering the inspiring stories of Iceland and Croatia - achieving the ultimate dreams of all smaller nations.

Perhaps you have frustration/fact you'd like to share? Or a crazy/funny story (even if it's rumor-level and unconfirmed)? What's the FA in your country doing to improve the development? Or are they the root cause of all evil? Or perhaps you've been on the opposite lane - there have been great improvements over the years and the future looks bright?

Share your stories!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's what it's like to be a Lithuanian football fan:

* National team is shit (haven't won an official game since **October 11, 2016**, and a friendly game since 27th of March, 2018);
* Youth isn't promising (U-15's just lost **0-9** to Georgia's U-15, with all due respect to them, it shouldn't be such a massive humiliation);
* Never in history made it to the Euros or the WC;
* Lithuania's [FIFA ranking](https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/associations/association=ltu/women/index.html) throughout the years basically sums up the national team's progress;
* The [national stadium](https://lff.lt/files/images/_resized/0000000060_990_300_cut.jpg) (the LFF stadium) is a fucking global embarrassment; 
* Club football is shit (average attendance is like 400 people; there's only 8 teams in the top division, but one basically went bankrupt, ceased its existence and is out of the league now, another one was on the verge of that as well, and another one is involved in a match fixing scandal);
* No club team in history made it to Europa League or Champions League;
* The Lithuanian Football Federation (the FA) is a corrupt piece of shit: 
   * executive board is made up of **convicted** individuals who have ties to the criminal underworld and people working in apparel company Hummel (who supply the national team's kits, I wonder how that happened); 
   * it's unclear where exactly the money from UEFA and FIFA goes to due to the lack of financial transparency; 
   * nepotism is the recruitment strategy of the FA's employees; 
   * the **National Academy was sold** because it didn't produce any good teams or players in the past decade or so; 
   * it got so bad that the Federation is barely getting any national funding and football isn't even considered to be a ""strategic"" sport anymore by the Sports Ministry, despite being easily one of the most popular sports in the country;
   * the LFF Cup (equivalent of FA Cup or Copa Del Rey) teams' draw saw a **half-naked girl dancing in a wind turbine** catching papers with the teams' names on them ([here's the full video](https://www.15min.lt/sportas/video/pasipiktinima-sukelusi-lff-taures-burtu-traukimo-ceremonija-vaizdo-irasas-158786)):

Anyway there's more where that came from, but I think you get the gist of it. I'd add sources, but they're all in Lithuanian. If anyone's really curious though, I can still send some links later on.

377,"Messi is better than Ronaldo, according to data science investigation","(Translated by [https://www.deepl.com/translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator))
&gt; Belgian scientific research: ""Messi has more impact than Ronaldo"".
&gt;  
&gt; Lionel Messi has a higher VAEP value than Cristiano Ronaldo.
&gt; Who is the best: Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? It is a question that many a football fan starts to work hard on, but a new study by the KU Leuven suddenly sheds an interesting light on the question. 
&gt; Computer scientists at KU Leuven, together with the Dutch data intelligence company SciSports, have developed a model that not only maps out the goals and assists of Messi and Ronaldo, but all the actions of the two star players.
&gt;
&gt; ""The value of a footballer is often determined by goals and assists,"" says Professor Jesse Davis. ""However, a goal is a rare event, as an estimated average of 1,600 actions take place in a match. Our model looks at each action - shots, passes, dribbles, tackles... - and calculates its value."" 
&gt;  
&gt; This value, called ""Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities"", indicates the extent to which a player's actions contribute to the result, both when scoring a goal and when preventing a goal from being scored. ""This gives you a more complete picture of a player and his value to the team,"" it sounds.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Messi takes the upper hand
&gt; The research focuses on the seasons 2013-2014 to 2017-2018 in the Spanish competition. It is not about the contributions of Messi and Ronaldo in the European leagues nor for their respective national team.
&gt;  
&gt; Final sum: Lionel Messi takes the upper hand. The Argentine of Barcelona has a VAEP value of 1.21. Ronaldo scores with 0.61 per game significantly less well.
&gt;  
&gt; ""In the first seasons the scores of Messi and Ronaldo are very close together"", says doctoral student Tom Decroos, who participated in the research.
&gt;  
&gt; ""As of the 2015-2016 season, Messi is moving away from his eternal rival. For most footballers, we see a trade-off: either they take a lot of actions with a lower value - this is the case with Paul Pogba, for example.
&gt;
&gt; ""Or you have players who are less likely to hit the ball, but who do have a major impact. This is typical for strikers like Harry Kane, Mohamed Salah and Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi is exceptional in this respect: the Argentinean carries out a very high number of actions and these also have a high value.""
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt; How does Hazard relate to Ronaldo?
&gt; Now that Cristiano Ronaldo is playing the tiles of the roof at Juventus, the researchers have wondered whether Eden Hazard at Real Madrid could be a suitable replacement for the Portuguese.
&gt;  
&gt; What does it show? In the season 2017-2018 (the last of Ronaldo at Real) the VAEP value of Ronaldo and Hazard is very close together. Hazard gets 0.64 per match. That means that Hazard ensured that his team (Chelsea) scored 0.64 goals more than the opponent. Ronaldo's impact on Real was slightly lower, at 0.61.
&gt;  
&gt; ""Hazard and Ronaldo have a similar contribution, although there are clear differences,"" says Lotte Bransen of SciSports.
&gt;  
&gt; ""Ronaldo is a classic scorer. His value is mainly determined by his good shots. Hazard is more involved in the game. His value is more spread over passes, dribbles and shots.""
&gt;  
&gt; ""We can conclude that Hazard is a good reinforcement for Real, but he is not a direct replacement for Ronaldo. Real Madrid will have to change its playing style.""

405,FC Bruges has agreement with Tottenham for Victor Wanyama (up to € 15 mil.),"Source: hnb.be

  
Club Brugge has an agreement with Tottenham Hotspur on an amount of ten million euros plus five million in bonuses for midfielder Victor Wanyama (28). It is now up to Wanyama to decide whether he will actually come to Bruges. If the deal goes through, the Kenyan will be the most expensive incoming transfer ever in Belgium. What certainly plays in favor of Club Brugge is the factor Clement. At Beerschot he played together with Wanyama and the two have had a good relationship since then. The initiative to attract Wanyama also comes from Clement itself.  Earlier the names of Gianelli Imbula (Stoke City) and Daniel Amartey (Leicester City) fell, but by choosing Wanyama, Club seems to want to reward his coach for his strong start to the season. If the transfer goes ahead, it would again be a tough blow to the league leader after the transfer of Simon Mignolet and the contract extension for Hans Vanaken.  The question is how many top level Wanyama can play.

14,Discussion: Non Over-reactive thoughts on Chelsea vs United.,"Firstly, as Expected Lampard is getting absolutely hammered in twitter reddit facebook and most other places. Some extent he deserves it. But lets look at it in less reactive way. (Please read my points before overreacting )

#History of Chelsea

This Chelsea team is known for crumbling last few seasons, Either its 4 - 0 against Bournemouth, 6 - 0 against Man City, 4 - 1 Against Tottenham, 2 - 0 Against Everton. This team under a world class coach Sarri and had a pretty bad defence. People expect Lampard to change it all of a sudden without a transfer Market ?

#Main Issues of Chelsea Today

Firstly, Admit it or not we had a good first half and played decent until 2-0. This is our team without our best Mid Fielder, Our best Defender Our best Attacking Mid Fielder, We still played some good stuff. With Rudiger, CHO, RLC, Kante returning we will improve so much better. It was our lack of clinical front of goal and individual mistakes costed us the game. Both of them Lampard had no hands over.

#Development of Young Players

Why are people treating 20/21 year olds Mount and Abraham as finished products ? I saw people saying they will go back to Championship this and that. Players Develop over the season. No one expected Tammy to bag a hat trick today. Clearly he is more mobile and more dynamic which fits what Frank is Trying to do.",soccer,1565547238,LubenRoftusCheek,126,131,True,2019-08-11

89,Idea for the Champions! Season 4,"I know most of yall don't give a fuck, but some people may find my idea enjoyable for the Champions, season 4. Yes, I know it's dumb, but it's objectively funny!

 You could make a joke about a Scottish terrier (named Bark) wearing argyle being the best fullback at Aberdeen or some Scottish club lol The Champions Season 4! Like have scouts at the famous Westminster Dog show... and they pick him bc he's got Scottish blood in him. He's a real Scot's Scot. and make it like the final reveal...where he gets burned by some winger in the Europa League, whatever the best English team that has to play in the Europa that year. And the winger gives a post match conference ""Yeah, we are really focusing on top 4 this year, so that we can play in the Champions League."" It's alright laddy, ya did yer best! it could be a whole episode just around this joke. It starts out with the coach praising him for his training and the how he's a good influence in the locker room, he lacks height, so we might try to play 5 at the back this season. And it shows the first game, where all the opposing team does is cross to the back post and score headers haha. And they still win the Scottish championship and he gets to wear the cute little medal haha and he got injured part way through the season, so he's on the sideline barking instructions with a little cast on his leg and Aberdeen score a goal directly after haha And he gets replaced when hes injured with the previously starting full back and it makes no difference in how they play haha And he starts to get fat and lose pace because his owner/dog trainer have to give him so many treats to get the coach's tactics right, bc his full backs are key to his system to provide the proper width and to track back haha. And he ruins an offside trap because he was pooping haha. But he always get's to play because he's important to team cohesion and the star player has a soft spot for him... And then more seriously one of the soccer players is questioning the purpose of his existence bc all he does is kick a ball good, but finds purpose in taking care of the terrier, so the argyle terrier prevents his suicide, and is voted Aberdeen's player of the year ironically and unironically haha. When he retires, the previously starting full back is still on the team, but they just put a piece of tree bark as the full back instead! And it still doesn't make a difference...and they make the Europa League again and play the same English team (either Arsenal or Chelsea) and the same winger gives the same post match conference! When Bark dies, his number is retired; a statue is erected and he plays soccer in heaven.

His chant whenever he has to poop (bc he needs to be given treats), goes like this:

Bark Bark!

He Poops when he wants!

He poops when he wants!

Bark Bark!

He barks when he wants!

He barks when he wants!

166,"[Discussion] Upon reading Jose Mourinho's comments which stated that Manchester City's B Team can win the league in England, I decided to look into the, 'B' teams for all the top 6 clubs in the Premier League and imagine how they would line up and what are your opinions on them?","So while I admit that my assessments may not be 100% correct and I've kept a generic formation with 3 midfielders and 3 forwards or wide players for each team, it'd be great to see a discussion to see as to who would win (at least on paper) the B Team Premier League if such a thing existed and while Man City seem like the undisputed champions, who would be next in line! Please discuss it in the comments below. 

Please note that while making the team sheets, the sheets may not look 100% balanced as per their respective playing styles but that is not the main point of this discussion, it is to measure depth and compare them. 

1. Let's start with **Manchester City**, the team with top players in each position: 

&amp;#x200B;

[Don't see any glaring areas of concern except the left centre back spot here. ](https://i.redd.it/k93l47bj6wf31.jpg)

I know that some players in this sheet did start for City in their GW1 squad but I wrote the sheets to be as strong as possible on paper meaning Mendy, Aguero, Bilva, Silva etc all got into the first team. 

2. Moving on, lets get to **Liverpool FC**, another favorites for the regular Premier League title, lets see how their second side would look if their best players on paper were in the first team.

&amp;#x200B;

[Liverpool's depth looks very thin when you look at the full back cover options and forward options but Origi turned up last season as a backup and Milner has been the utility man for quite a while and has been doing the job well.](https://i.redd.it/93fvupf97wf31.jpg)

3.  Let us now take a look at the Transfer Banned **Chelsea** and see if this window where they could only add Pulisic, Kovacic and recall some loanees to their team and how they could line up without their first team: 

&amp;#x200B;

[A little light at the centre back depth where they could easily be exploited, Chelsea look decently equipped in the midfield and the forward line and surprisingly has a pretty solid B team lineup.](https://i.redd.it/ta8x2xps7wf31.jpg)

   4. Last year's fourth place finishers, **Spurs** are up next and lets see what a busy summer from Levy's chequebook has brought upon Tottenham's depth: 

&amp;#x200B;

[Spurs were the biggest surprise for me, they probably look the second best on this list according to me tbh. I know this lineup makes you wonder what on earth was I thinking including 3 attacking midfielders in their first XI but on paper, this is probably the closest thing to a B team for Spurs minus the sensational Son but he just couldn't nail down a spot against Alli and Eriksen in the attacking spots.](https://i.redd.it/amjkvjv68wf31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

   5.  Then we have the **Gunners** headed by Unai Emery and his magic of turning 40 mil into quite a lot more than what you might've imagined. 

&amp;#x200B;

[This felt to me as if it was the weakest as a B team given there's a lot of underperformers in this X1, specially from the midfield and up where the most promising players, to me are the youth players.](https://i.redd.it/c4t9395t8wf31.jpg)

  6. And finally, the host must always be the last one to introduce themselves, **Manchester United** and their squad depth. I will not really comment on United because there may be a fair bit of bias attached in my opinions and I'd let you guys have a fresh opinion of them.   

&amp;#x200B;

[Lot of deadwood but if you take it out then its only the academy so yeah! ](https://i.redd.it/ejhiowkd9wf31.jpg)

These, according to me are the best possible second XIs for the top 6 premier league teams and again, they're arguably based on paper and I haven't taken into account all the factors like form etc. 

What are your opinions on Mourinho's comments and who do you think would have the best second lineup after Man City or do you feel like there's a lineup better than theirs? Its 4 am in my country so I will hit the sack now but I spent a fair amount of time trying to make this post so I hope to read some interesting viewpoints when I wake up.

223,A Recap of Manchester United's Managerial Woes &amp; Reaction to 8/11/19 game VS Chelsea,"This is the post-game reaction of the Red Devil's 2019-2020 season opener.

This team has had a real turn around. Ole Gunnar Solskjær (OGS for the remainder of this post) has definitely turned this team around. First off, to really understand the OGS effect, we need to review Manchester's managerial woes and José's time as manager.

After the exit of arguably one of the greatest managers of all of pro sports, Manchester United needed to fill a void left by Sir Alex Ferguson. Manchester United became a revolving door of managers until the 2016-17 season. Managers like David Moyes, (1 month caretaker) Ryan Giggs, and Louis Van Gaal were hired and fired. The 3 years only produced a FA Cup and a FA Community Shield. The future of the Red Devils looked bleak. However, the ultimate showdown was brewing...

February 2016, Managerial genius Pep Guardiola signs for bitter rivals Manchester City. May 2016, José ""The Special One"" Mourinho signs for Manchester United. 2 Rivalries were rekindled, and the storied manager feud of José vs Pep took another chapter. (To summarize the feud, both came from La Masia (Barcelona's development camp), and both went for the prestigious Barcelona manager opening. However, Pep Guardiola was chosen for the job for his ""attacking &amp; exciting football"" while José was rejected. José became manager of Real Madrid, adding more gasoline to the fire that is the El Clasico.)

The defensive specialist brought in big names such as Lukaku, Pogba, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his first year as manager. Manchester United was hyped to be a competitive league team, and a 5th &amp; 6th place finish made dreams of succeeding with José seem distant. José had won the Europa League, League Cup, &amp; Community shield in the 2016-17 season (a treble...kind of). However, with the 2017-2018 ending with Manchester City lifting the trophy, the pressure was on ""The Special One"" to bring major silverware. Aspirations of success were prevalent and José became a media punching bag. The team was visibly lacking in chemistry, happiness, and skill set. However, I feel their struggles were all based on José's ultra defensive tactics, mercenary like transfers, and crude misplacement of players. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to tell you that defensive football leads to a lack of goals. Buying players for 30-60 million pounds just to sit on the bench is terrible business. It isn't a mystery that a creative genius in Paul Pogba shouldn't be playing CDM because he is tall. It was a combination of simple mistakes, constant bad performances, and a gross misuse of players that led the club to a depressing state.

Halfway through the 2018-19 season, José was sacked and OGS took his spot, José can be compared to the mean stepmother in every Disney movie. OGS can be compared to the kind fairy godmother. OGS immediately reminded players and staff that football is supposed to be fun. OGS first day of work with the club, he brought office workers cookies and chatted with them. He made Manchester United feel like a family and not factory.

OGS embraced Sir Alex Ferguson's mindset and trusted in the youth of the team. The sales of older players such as Lukaku (26), Herrera (29), and Valencia (34) opened up first team spots for youth products such as Rashford (21), McTominay (22) , Martial (23), etc. OGS also got youngsters Wan-Bissaka (21) &amp; James (21) as well defensive stud Harry ""Slabhead"" Maquire.

So, now lets talk about the scenes at Old Trafford on the home opener. The average age of the starting XI was 24 years old. It was nearly my dream lineup. Lingard, Martial, Rashford should always be up front, that pace and determination was a breath of fresh air. Lukaku nor Zlatan would've made the runs they made today. McTominay, Pereira, and Pogba struggled a little bit in the possession, but made up for it with incisive forward passing. That Pogba assist was incredible and shows exactly what he's capable of when he's given freedom \*cough cough\*. The defense had very bright moments, Wan-Bissaka with a few good tackles and explosive runs, Maguire with threatening headers and good defending, and Shaw &amp; Lindelöf stepping up. However, their were threatening chances that need to be addressed. Chelsea hit the bar 2-3 times that game and the scoreline easily could've been 3-2 Chelsea instead of 4-0 United. De Gea made a few basic saves and got lucky that he kept a clean sheet thanks to that ""skinny white friend"" Ray Hudson refers to as the post.

In conclusion, OGS has the tactics and formation right. Attacking football will always be in Manchester United's DNA because of Sir Alex Ferguson and I believe that's why ""The Special One"" struggled. The young players filled with potential means Old Trafford will become the Theatre of Dreams once again. Now, Will Manchester United win the league this year? Probably not. Can they win the Europa league? Maybe. Will Manchester United play fun and exciting football again? Yes. Will Manchester be a competitive team in a few years? Yes. I give it 1 to 2 years before we can start talking about Champions League football and winning the League again. In the end of the day, the players look happy, the manager looks happy, &amp; I'm happy. The Red Devils are back on the right track.",soccer,1565578561,4StarSports,1,1,True,2019-08-11

Chelsea were able to win the thing while using their subs and reserves for 90% of the matches. The Champions League means you must play your best team or you get eliminated, leaving your team tired and squad depleted, which will usually take a pretty heavy toll on the players and the team's performance for the season.

And then comes the better part : Joao Felix as his forward partner, finding space. At 23 he will be already one of worlds top5-7 players IMO(!). Very similar to Griezman in how he can strike the ball effortlessly and find space.

Bernardo Silva, who to me was a top3 player last year, will be 27 or 28, great age. His partner Bruno Fernandes is also a world class player at same age.

And then Portugal has many 3.5 or 4 star players to fill in all other positions, such as Cancelo (who will be crucial in this very narrow set up, providing amazing crosses for the killers in box), Semedo, Neves, Danilo P., Jota etc. Also some young talent like Leao, Trincao etc

424,Why Super Cups should be played mid season and not in August,"As you can tell by the title, I believe that Super cups like the Community Shield, DFL Super Cup and all the others (except UEFA Super Cup) should be played mid season instead of at the start, like how it is in Serie A

**Why the super cup shouldn't be in August?**

As of right now, super cups are glorified friendlies and there's not much of an argument against that. Players are not match fit, everyone is focused on the transfer window and everyone is excited for the upcoming season. What does this mean? The super cup taking a back seat. The super cup should be an important game, but unfortunately it is not, as both teams are still in pre season mode and are at the weakest point they will be all season. How many times have you guys been focusing on your clubs' transfer activity or pre season tournaments, only to realize that the Super Cup starts in an hour. The Super Cup shouldn't just come out of the blue, it should be marked on your calendar as a game that you eagerly wait to watch, which unfortunately isn't the case. 


**Why the super cup should be mid season?**

Clubs are at their peak form, and the expectations of the season has been laid out. Would you rather watch City vs Liverpool in August, or January? This leads to an actual high quality match, and more importantly, clubs will take the super cup seriously because they know it can give them a well needed bump that they can use to push on for the rest of the season. I can tell you right now that when the Super Cup was moved from August to January, clubs began to take it very seriously, and consider it a legitimate trophy, not a meaningless friendly. They use the trophy as a tool to kick on the second half of the season and push for their respective goals. It can turn what has been a disappointing season into a positive one. Having the Super Cup at the halfway point is the perfect way signal the end of the first half of the season and beginning of the second, with high quality match between 2 teams who are fighting as hard as they can for a trophy in what actually feels like a final 


tldr. Super cups in August are not taken seriously and are meaningless friendlies with teams who are not match fit. When Serie A moved super cup from August to January, clubs began to take it seriously and it actually felt like a final in a very high quality match.

###**Last season**

Last season, as for many clubs, saw a lot of our players return from the World Cup in glory. We had a record three players play for England with Vardy, Chilwell, and Maguire all playing their part. Maguire in particular has gone down as the first Leicester City player for scoring for England, and has since saw his popularity soar! The excitement grew as we signed Maddison and Ricardo to bolster the ranks with the prior trying to fill the recent Mahrez shaped hole and the latter replacing Simpson.

Yet the season would not continue in the same vein with Puel at the centre of a lot it, and come to terms after we won to the Premier League in that fateful season. The manager was tasked to change our team from a counter-attacking side to an adaptive side that could compete for European football. At first, we did well showing form against Wolves at home and putting United to the coals in our first match. We started to show frustrations against sides that defended deeply such as Bournemouth. Though as per usual show character by gaining two goals at the end to a four against.

Then, as we all know, came the fateful October where we lost our beloved Chairman Khun Vichai. After a dreadful game at home against West Ham that would become normal at home games, Vichai took off in his helicopter from the pitch and this time it would crash killing all those inside. After this, we had a spirited and emotional game against Cardiff as football rallied behind us yet again in our history, but under sadder circumstances. From their, whether you liked Puel or not, he managed the team with grace and the press with diplomacy.

As part of the aftermath, the team diligently pressed on and continued to struggle against sides in deep block such as Burnley. It was evident we did not have the right tactics to break these sides down and it would begin to frustrate blue army.

Though as a reprieve, Leicester's form picked up in the winter where we took scalps from both Chelsea, Everton, and on quite a memorable boxing day match: Man City. A cautious optimism came again in Puel's project and we would continue into the season though luck would see us repeatedly say ""It was good football, but we didn't get the results"".
 This was true against Wolves, Spurs, and plenty of other teams where we just seemed to lack an X factor. Even with Tielemans introduced to the club on loan and impressing at the Spurs away match, the optimism was short-lived. It came to a head when we played Crystal Palace (a team we've historically struggled with over the last few seasons). There we suffered the embarrassing 1-4 loss to Palace that saw the last of Claude Puel.

After that, Leicester had an uncharacteristically quick turn around in getting a new manager in Brendan Rodgers. As he took the helm for the first time against Watford, the team already showed an impetus building despite the loss. As Tielemans came up to speed with the Premier League and Rodgers took the helm, the Foxes finally seemed rejuvenated as seen by Vardy's 7 goals in the last six games. The game against Arsenal at home and the slim defeat at Man City solidified that we could be a side to be reckoned with. Our renewed confidence in the team and blue army has entered our summer, which would see us see two major transfer sagas, and two record signings within a week!

###**This Season** 
 

As many are aware, we have been some of the biggest spenders and the centre of the ever-silly Harry Maguire saga. In this transfer window we have shown faith, solidarity, and optimism in our journey to get European football and break the top 6. This has been represented in our shrewd yet major purchases in Perez, James Justin, and most importantly: Youri Tielemans. With Perez, it was a major statement to pay the full asking price mid-window instead of haggling throughout the window. With James Justin, we continue to find promising players that are to be our next generation of Foxes and possibly even internationals! Lastly, Tielemans was our major coup with many doubting if we could and having to fend out potential interest from heavy-weights such as United and Spurs. This combined with not being forced to sell Maguire, Top, son of Vichai, is showing true backbone and investment into our beloved club.

This has been extended to our 'ordinary' preseason as we are the only Premier League side to not leave the UK (bar the training camp) during the preseason. This has allowed the team to focus on football and fitness. I have personally been to one match, and watched the rest religiously with lots of promise coming out of them. Albrighton, a veteran of Leicester, has been sharper than ever along with the likes of Maddison, Chiwell, Ricardo, and new signing Perez showing proper talent. The most enticing part of the squad is that Tielemans and Vardy link that saw Vardy surpass Harry Kane (albeit due to injury) in goals last season.

We Foxes are more optimistic than we have been in a while with our side that seems to be evolving into a top 6 breaking side. Though we are aware that we are not the only challengers that can smell blood in the water. Wolves, Everton, Watford, West Ham and perhaps others will make the midtable a proper dogfight. With our squad, I feel confident it's in Leicester to really shake things up and challenge for cups as well. As Rodgers finalises his 'strongest XI', the Premier League may be in store for another major shake up.

**3 players to watch out for**  
 
[](#icon-star-big) **Youri Tielemans**

Youri Tielemans brought a magic to the midfield we have not seen sine that days of Esteban Cambiasso (he's magic you know!). His link up play with Jamie Vardy is amazing and beauty to us Foxes to watch. Their link up has helped Jamie Vardy score 7 goals in the last six games of last season. This was enabled by Youri, who in half a season, scored three goals along with five assists of which most were to Vardy. His through balls are perfect to Rodger's system that has seen both Tielemans and Maddison clearly drilled in keeping the ball in the ground during our pre-season. The days of counter-attacking side to an adaptive side are finally here without the contention under Puel. Rodgers will utilise Tielemans and make him even better to be our most formidable player. If he and Vardy can continue that form then I believe we have the ability to grab a position for European football.

[](#icon-star-big) **James Maddison**

James Maddison has brought a great energy to our game along with Tielemans though in a different way. In his debut season, he has seven assists AND seven goals to his name. Of these goals, three were from free kicks, which was the most amount scored from free kicks in the PL last season. Where Tielemans is good with fluid play, Maddison is the king of the dead ball and will be essential to our set pieces.

Where you will find synergy from Maddison and Tielemans is that they both have been given a lot of creative licence by Rodgers. With that, their ability to find space and harry the back line will be pivotal to how we will break down blocks that had previously frustrated us as a team particularly at home. The pair will prove deadly to those who under-estimate as they will become easily some of the best midfielders in the league as they find spaces and place balls straight to Vardy whose ruthlessness will see the ball hit the back of the next.

On another note, Maddison is a promising English international who could help Leicester return to having three English Internationals and possibly more with the likes of Hamza, Barnes, and Gray knocking on the door. Whilst this may not seem like a big deal for some of the 'bigger clubs', for Leicester to only have previously one notable player for England whilst at Leicester (Gordon Banks) to three is an amazing statement of our club. As such, I suspect Maddison will become more prominent in the Senior team having impressed in the U23s for the last possible time. He will then hopefully show the way to other talents like Maguire and Chiwell before him.

[](#icon-star-big) **Marc Albrighton**

To limit the three stars to watch this season was hard. We have an optimism not seen since the winning season and have a lot of talent and promise these season with the likes of Ndidi, Ricardo, Chilwell, Perez, and so on. Yet for those who follow the preseason there has been one player who has shone brighter than anyone else: *Marc Albrighton*

Albrighton, 'Sharky' to us Foxes, has been with us since 2014 and has Mr Consistent for us time and time again. Yet under this preseason, he's beginning to live up to the name. He has score some excellent goals and has been sharp as a shark since minute one of playing this preseason. I'm convinced he will become a regular as part of Rodger's ""strongest XI"" and if he keeps up that form he will easily break the cycle of scoring just two goals per season. Who knows, he may finally realise his dream to an England call up though I'll be ecstatic for him to recreate his form in the PL and live up to a potential I don't think any of us knew he had before.

Never say old dogs can't learn new tricks!

**What the fans think**
 
Thanks to r/lcfc [for their help.](https://old.reddit.com/r/lcfc/comments/ck9ve3/contributions_to_leicesters_rsoccer_premier/)
 
&gt; **How do you think this season will go?**
 
*Really exciting times for us going into this season, talented young squad that have now had a year together with a couple of quality additions in Perez and Tielemans as well as a very good manager. I believe since Rodgers came in we were 3rd or 4th in the form table, although that may have also been due to the awful run of results from Chelsea, Arsenal, united and Spurs. I expect us to be fighting for that 7th spot and definitely some good cup runs, if we don't get European football next year we will lose a lot of key players. I think we will definitely be playing some exciting football which will be good for any neutrals watching.*

* /u/Patty040701

*I'd be disappointed if we finish below 8th this season, and I don't think top 6 or even 4 is outlandish. Over the last few seasons since the fairytale we've really built a solid young squad that finished last season very strongly under Rogers. Even if Maguire goes (which I honestly don't see happening this late) I doubt any fox will be too worried, last season he wasn't even our best CB. The end of last season reminded me of the great escape, and we've seen that LCFC are capable of carrying on form from one season to the next. If I had to pick a final position I'd go with 6th.*

* /u/JustTheAverageJoe

*This is probably the most excited and confident I have been going into a new season in a long time, we have built on our already very solid, young core with a couple of fantastic additions in Tielemans and Perez, and also James Justin, who from what I’ve read/heard is a very good pick up to offer cover for both RB and LB. Providing we keep a hold of Maguire, which I think we will, I think this is the season that we can really look to push the top 6 and get into Europe. Once Rodgers came in last season we looked like a different team and if we can continue the form we showed at the back end of last season there’s really no reason why we should be looking to finish any lower than 7th.*

* /u/bakedestbean


&gt; **Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**
 
*The one player I was absolutely desperate for us to sign over the summer was Tielemans, so I’m delighted we got our man after a great half-season loan spell last season. He came straight into the side and slotted in perfectly alongside Maddison to offer even more of an attacking threat with his excellent pin point passes and forward vision, 3 goals and 4 assists in 13 games speaks for itself coming into a very challenging league as a 21 year old (at the time). A midfield trio of Maddison and Tielemans providing the attacking threat and the ever reliable Ndidi for defensive stability behind them will be a pleasure to watch this season.*

* /u/bakedestbean

*A lot of players to choose from. Prime candidates include: Pereira, Maddison, Barnes, Tielemans and Perez. But I'm going to go with Vardy. This could be his last season as our starting striker and I think it's going to be a big one for him personally. With Maddison, Tielemans and Pereira supplying him, we could be looking at a 20+ goal season for him. One of the most clinical strikers in the league, all he lacks is more chances and with the addition of Tielemans specifically, he's going to be provided with plenty.*

* /u/TheHairyBanana

*Pereira may well end up being our POTY again this season. Our more agressive play under Rogers seems to really suit him and he's looking lethal as ever in preseason. It's early days but him and Perez look to be linking up well, so having someone else in the box other than Vardy to get on the end of his crosses can only be a good thing.*

* /u/samuse
 
&gt; **How do you think the team will line up?**

*Lineup 4-1-4-1*

*Schmeichel - Pereira Evans Maguire Chilwell - Ndidi - Perez Tielemans Maddison Albrighton - Vardy*

* /u/TheHairyBanana

*Schmeichel; Ricardo, Evans, Maguire, Chilwell; Tielemans, Ndidi, Maddison; Perez, Vardy. Free for all on who the last winger is, I suspect Albrighton will probably have it first game but Barnes and Gray will be in the mix for it as well*

###Wrap Up
by /u/NickTM
 
-
 
**The Manager:** **Brendan Rodgers.** Isn't it good to have the mental old David Brent impersonator back from a spell in Scotland? Taking over from Claude Puel's dour defensive tactics reasonably early in the season, Rodgers brought his usual mix of high pressing and attacking, possession-based play to the table. He's kept it reasonably quiet in the media so far, but I'm sure he'll be back to describing possession as ""a football death for the other side"" and brandishing envelopes with players' names in them.
 
**The Team:** Plenty of likeability to be found in the team, given /r/soccer's own Christian Fuchs still supporting Ben Chilwell in the left back position. Harry Maguire is an ongoing transfer saga, with the centre-back linked to Man Utd for practically the entire close season but Leicester refusing to budge on price tag. With Maguire anchoring a defensive line that includes the ageing Wes Morgan and Jonny Evans, you'd have to expect new signings there if he goes. Wilfried Ndidi continues to go from strength to strength in midfield alongside Youri Tielemans, who made his loan permanent a few weeks ago. Ahead of them, James Maddison plys his trade behind, as ever, Jamie Vardy. There's a good mix of age and experience throughout, but there'll be concerns about the advancing age of Vardy especially.
 
**Why to like them:** The residual feeling of *that* season has yet to fully die off, it seems. Ser Marc Albrighton is still plying his trade as the last of his line of the House of Industrious Out And Out Wide Midfielders (House Motto: Get It Wide And Whip It). Nampalys Mendy has a wonderful song. Youri Tielemans is part of that vaunted group of players so slow that occasionally they just decide to take a long shot instead because it'll save them running anywhere (see Hitzlsperger, Thomas).

**Why to dislike them:** Jamie Vardy and his wife tried to trademark 'Chat Shit Get Banged', and then his wife tried denying it. When your denial is so bad that even /r/soccer isn't fooled, you know you've both chatted shit and got judicially banged. Foxes where I lived basically subsist on rubbish and keep you up all night by scream-fucking in the nearby park. Apart from that, there isn't too much to hate about Leicester, which in itself is actually intensely annoying. Wankers.

**Summary:** Could go either way, this one. Vardy's production won't last forever, and the shelf life on a quick striker that relies on his burst is never too long. Apart from Vardy, though, the team's mostly solid, with the caveat that if Maguire goes they could enter the season in a bit of a crisis at centre-back. Ayoze Perez has shone in patches for Newcastle; he'll need to prove his worth quickly if Vardy begins the first steps of the final slope down, especially given the outlay Leicester put out for him. Rodgers' worth as a manager at this level has been proven multiple times, so they at very least can rely on his skill and experience to guide them. If everything holds together, you'd expect them to challenge for Europe, but you could also see them settling for midtable if they get some critical injuries.",soccer,1564687593,NickTM,22,119,True,2019-08-01

|*1974-1988*|*Juventus*|*377*|*24*|

Gaetano Scirea was born in the Milanese hinterland (remote area). His dad was of Sicilian origin and was working for Pirelli, while his mom was from Lombardi. Scirea's interest in the sport started very early on. Scirea would, at the age of 10, play for his local team ""Serenissima"" di Cinisello Balsamo. After being at the club for 4 years, he would leave to join Atalanta's youth academy. Atalanta's academy was the highest-rated academy in Italy at the time. Scirea would start out as a right midfielder for Atalanta's youth team. His time as right midfielder gave him the excellent touch of the ball and an elegant run with the ball. However, his great vision often led him more centrally on the pitch which was the reason he played as a midfielder over time. 

When Scirea played for the primavera, he was working in his uncle's workshop in Cernusco sul Naviglio, a thing he would maintain even after his debut in Serie A. Ilario Castagner's, the coach of Atalanta, next project was Scirea. Ilario didn´t like Scirea's role on the right because Scirea was limited in his working space, which is why he was given a free role. 

![img](vdyxqzc0dtd31 ""A young Scirea at Atalanta"")

After performing amazingly in the free role he would get his debut for the first team. Gaetano Scirea made his debut in Serie A on 24 September 1972 against Cagliari - Atalanta in a 0-0 draw. In this game, Scirea would replace the injured Savoy in the sweeper position. He impressed the fans with his security in this role. During the season there were various discussions born both within the Bergamo society and in the press on the opportunity to make Scirea a defender despite his talents in midfield. Scirea expressed himself that his preference was in the role of a mezzala. After another game as a starter in a 0-0 draw at home against Napoli, lost Scirea his place in the starting 11 and was replaced by the returning Savoy ; after only one game (the 9-3 defeat on the Milan) he continued to play as a starter, as sweeper or as a midfielder according to Atalanta´s needs. 

![img](kdlsd6bddtd31)

After playing 20 matches in the top flight and 2 matches in the Coppa Italia, he would stay in Bergamo the following season even though they played in Serie B after relegation, which was decided by goal difference. On the first day of the league, he would play his last game as a midfielder with Atalanta in a 1-0 defeat on the pitch of Como, but already in the second game, it was decided by the new coach neroazzurro Heriberto Herrera that Scirea should play sweeper. He played in all 38 league games (he also scored a goal on 12 May 1974 in a 2-1 game lost on campo del Brindisi). 

Scirea as a player would be described as playing with elegance and an incredible sense of fairness. The complete absence of expulsions stands out, a fact more unique than rare for a player of his role. His movement is extremely similar to Baresi and Beckenbauer. Scirea was the most elegant defender to ever play with his movement and technique, which he developed from playing as a midfielder when he was young. Scirea had a brilliant tactical mind and was an incredible leader. His biggest task was keeping the hothead Gentile under control which he was amazing at. Scirea getting the ball was one of the most exciting things to watch because he had a magical drive while being the playmaker in the penalty box. Maldini has taken many of the aspects of his game from Scirea with being composed and sweet in the defensive actions. 

&gt;Gianni Mura said it perfectly when describing him ""When he was a child, he dreamt of Suárez and Rivera, the magic number 10, the conductor of the orchestra. He got there regardless, with the magic number 6: director of the defence and supporter of the midfield and attack""

![img](ubq3f0oidtd31 "" The director of the defence "")

His offensive game was outstanding with the ability to redress the attack and to deliver valuable assists. The reason why he was the most complete defender of all time was because of his ability to dictate the tempo of the game and his incredible vision of the pitch. Scirea transformed the ""Libero"" role because his tasks were to be the free man always and recoup any lost balls. A special task for him at times was to man-mark their opponent strongest card, for example, Napoli´s Maradona. He was the only player to be able to stop Maradona multiple times. The most known moment is the double man-marking in 1982 by him and Gentile. Gentile being aggressive while Scirea waited to get in if Maradona passes Gentile. 

&gt;“A gentleman, a great opponent. His death gave me a lot, a lot of pain.” - Diego Maradona.

![video](di48knqydtd31)

Gaetano Scirea's move to Juventus was expected because of the privileged channel between Atalanta and Juventus at the time. Juventus' interested for Scirea happened because they were looking for a replacement for their sweeper Sandro Salvadore, who was about to retire. Scirea immediately seemed suitable to be that replacement. Gaetano was coming into a Juventus team full of stars. He would come into a defence composed of Cuccureddu, Gentile (his partner in crime), Spinosi and Francesco Morini. As a 21-year-old Scirea would play 28 out of 30 games in his first season at the Old lady. The Old lady won their 16th title that season and this was Scirea's first title. Scirea would make his international debut on December 30, 1975, at the age of 22, in a friendly match against Greece in a 3-2 win. 

![img](dtyinuw1etd31 "" Elegance is the word to describe Scirea. "")

He was the protagonist of Juventus' double (Scudetto - UEFA Cup) in 1976-77. Juventus won the scudetto with 51 points, which was at the time was a record in a 16-team tournament with 2 points per victory. They were competing the whole season against Torino and just finished 1 point in front. The UEFA Cup final was against a tough Athletic Bilbao to complete the double. This was the first confederal competition won by Juventus.

Scirea would take part in the 1978 World Cup squad, being one of the best players for the Azzurri, with Jonathan Stevenson calling him and Rossi the best watch of the tournament. Bearzot´s brillance in that tournament was using the Juventus core in defence with Cabrini, Zoff, Gentile and Scirea, which was the best defence in the world at the time. Italy came in fourth place. The following season Scirea would take his third Serie A title.

![img](g4zeaig7etd31)

Juventus would have tough times the following 3 years without a title, in the meantime was there a European Championship in 1980. Italy came fourth again which was a massive disappointment because they were the home team. Juventus would win the title in 1981. Scirea was the biggest star on the team when they won their twentieth championship, which gave the right to use the second star on their badge.

1982 would be the best year of his career and weirdly enough was he without the Ballon d´Or (Paolo Rossi won it). The World Cup 1982 was a performance of a world-class defence with a pragmatic system built on the Juventus core, while Paolo Rossi was on fire upfront. Italy started out the tournament with big problems in attack and that´s why they ended with 3 draws. They would later kick out the two favourites in Brazil (Socrates, Zico) and Argentina (Kempes, Maradona). To make 1982 even better for Scirea and Juventus, the greatest European footballer (at the time) would sign with them.

![img](mxip2tybetd31 "" Scirea winning the World Cup 1982"")

The last trophy Scirea needed to win was the Champions League which Platini would help them win after taking another title in 1984 and a Cup winners´ Cup after beating Porto 2-1. The Champions League win the following year for Juventus would end tragically at Heysel Stadium 1985. Scirea would also win the Intercontinental Cup and this time was he even the captain of the team. The last trophy before retiring at 35 years was another Serie A title which was his 7th Serie A title. He became the first player ever, along with his teammate Antonio Cabrini, to have won all the official football club competitions and at the same time contributing to making Juventus the first team to show all the tournaments organized by UEFA on the bulletin board.

![img](73hdgbxfetd31 "" Scirea´s collection of trophies. "")

With the national team, Scirea had 78 appearances (10 of which as captain) and 2 goals. After his retirement, Scirea pursued a coaching career. He was already the deputy coach, but unfortunately, Scirea would never become a coach because he died in a car accident at the age of 36 in 1989. 

&gt;Gianni Mura in 1989 after Scirea death ""With Gaetano Scirea, one of the cleanest faces in our football has gone.""

For me, he is the third-best center back/libero of all time after Beckenbauer and Baresi but is more interesting to watch than both of them. I don´t think Baresi or Beckenbauer is much better than Scirea. Scirea was apart of the greatest centre back paring ever with him and Gentile. They were the most consistent pairing and have won most things together, except Gentile didn´t win Champions League.

&amp;#x200B;

I may have said it before but because off-season is almost over, I think about two ideas which weren't mentioned in the video:

\-Unlimited rotation, just like basketball. It can be done whenever the game stops (corner-kick, free-kick, goal, etc). That way, not only star players will rest more, but it will enable young players to play more, even during crucial games. For that, it's up to the coach.

\-It will lead to controversy: reduce the number of teams in leagues. Going from 20 to 16 teams will reduce the calendar and thus, giving more rest to players.",soccer,1564738762,Moug-10,18,0,True,2019-08-02

62,"Analysis of Gareth Bale since joining Real Madrid: 19 injuries suffered, 73 games missed, with 375 days on the sidelines. [Transfermarkt]","For the most part, especially earlier on into his Real Madrid tenure, Gareth Bale’s on the pitch performances had rarely been questioned. The problem mainly lied with his inability to get onto the pitch in the first place.  

From the statistical point of view, Gareth Bale’s output at Real Madrid is more than satisfactory with him averaging about a goal scored every other game played. 

What often times goes missing is the fact that he may score every two games, but then he’ll be injured in the third game which is essentially a “0 performance” for the club, as one cannot provide anything to the team if they’re not on the pitch. 

Additionally, likely due to the build-up of injuries his on the pitch performances have recently declined as well. 

NOTE: the following stats are taken from “whoscored” and are only domestic stats that have been averaged on a per game basis.

Stats clearly show that there’s a dip in Bale’s performances recently. In my opinion, it is due to the sheer amount of injuries suffered. The eye-test also tells me he doesn’t have that same acceleration and pace as he used to. To me at least, he seems a lot less involved/motivated while on the pitch which may be part of the reason as to why most of his stats have decreased. 

With all that being said, no matter the injuries, Bale has consistently shown himself to be a player who scores the biggest goals in the biggest of games. For this reason he will go down in history and that cannot ever be taken away from him. Even though his career at Real Madrid has been up and down, for the most part it has been up:

83,The importance of backing your coach,"OC by u/vik1980 on r/FCInterMilan . All credit goes to him 

Generally, whenever a new coach is appointed, he has his specific requests for the players he wants, and the system he'll play. Many times, this preference might clash with the view of the club's management. They then have to decide whether to follow the coaches recommendations, or to thrust their own choices on to him. Blindly following him might severely limit, or even jeopardise a clubs financial future. Not following him is the equivalent of crippling him even before he's begun his job. 

I'll give a couple of classic examples of this very situation. 

---

**Case 1**  [Mourinho leaves for Real and Inter appoint Gasperini] (2011)

After Mou left Inter for Real, and Benitez struggled int he subsequent season, they hired what was regarded as a great young coaching prospect in Gasperini, who'd consistently overachieved at Genoa. Even Mou, while at Real, complimented this choice, and said he liked how Gasp adjusted on the field to everything Mou tried in their direct encounters. 

Gasp had used the 3-4-3 formation, the same formation he uses today at Atalanta, to wide acclaim. To suit his formation, he recommended to the club that Sneijder, a creative attacking midfielder, be sold, to retain the services of Eto'o, a pacy &amp; flexible forward capable of playing anywhere in attack, and to get him Rodrigo Palacio, a player similar to Eto'o, from his old club. The club, no longer able to afford the heavy wages or the inflated transfer fees, did the exact opposite. They sold Eto'o, who had a rich offer from Anzhi, kept Sneijder and ignored Palacio for another year. 

Result : Gasperini was fired 5 games into the season. And Inter struggled to replace Mou for a long time afterwards. Gasp went on to establish the same system in Atalanta, to much critical acclaim, developing youngsters and making his club money in the process. 

One can only wonder what might've happened if Inter had shown in him support at the start. There's no guarantee he would've succeeded, but his exploits after leaving Inter point to a 'what if' scenario with promise. 

---

**Case 2** [Inter appoint Mancini] (2015)

Tired of struggling under acclaimed but not big name coaches like Gasperini, Stramaccioni and Mazzari, Inter went and hired a big name, but one who also had a history with the club; Mancini. Mancini took over from the recently fired Mazzari, and guided the club competently, narrowly missing out on the Champions League qualification. The following season, his Inter led the league comfortably, till things took a turn for the worse in Dec.-Jan. They never recovered, failing yet again to qualify for the Champions League. 

At the send of the season, while they'd again not fulfilled their objective of qualifying for the Champions League, the club still believed in him. Mancini, however, was tired of struggling, and did not agree with the clubs emphasis on the development of young players for the future. He wanted to sell Icardi, who'd carved up a name for himself, use the funds to pay for the big wages of Yaya Toure, and old Mancini favourite at Manchester City, and Zlatan from PSG, and then go after Juve's reign of dominance in Serie A. 

Result : The club refused, and Mancini bolted before the campaign even started. That entire following season was a mess, first under De Boer, then Pioli, with two interim stints from Vecchi. Judging by the sharp decline of Yaya, injuries for Zlatan, and continued explosion of Icardi, the club was right to reject Mancini's vision here. 

---

**Case 3** [Inter hire Spalletti] (2017)

Having to replace Mancini, and seen the unmitigated disaster of De Boer's ensure, Inter hired a competent manager in Spalletti, the best available at the time, and assigned him the burden of qualification to the Champions League as his primary objective. He achieves his objective in his first season. Albeit kicking and screaming, and in the last few minutes of the last game of the season, he did achieve his objective. In return, the club decided to back him when he demanded a 30 yo Nainggolan, one with a physical style of play, a penchant for partying and ignoring disciplinary rules, and a sharp decline visible on the horizon. They even gave up a youth talent like Zaniolo to facilitate the purchase. 

Result : Nainggolan struggles with injuries, yet continued to create disciplinary problems, and Zaniolo exploded at Roma in an unprecedented way. And yet, it was Nainggolan's goal that helped qualify for the Champions League for a second time in a row, again on the final day of the season.

The three cases show the different results that backing a coach can bring. It can either work, or not, or work partially, but with shortcomings. And while the examples are all for Inter, I'm sure the same thing applies at all clubs. Mou wanting Perisic at Manchester United, Zidane insisting on Pogba, while ignoring a much more available and cheaper Eriksen, and the Roma and Bayern boards completely ignoring EdF and Kovac.

The reason I raise this point now is because I see Milan fans complaining about Milan going for Angel Correa of Atletico Madrid, and Inter fans complaining about Conte insisting on Lukaku, while completely undermining the likes of Perisic and others. In my experience, in most cases, it makes far more sense to back a coach than to not. 

---

**Milan**

Giampaolo is now pretty much in the same situation that Gasperini was when he moved to Inter. He has a reputation for being a competent &amp; tactical coach, one who develops youth, manages player turnaround, and plays with an attractive style. It just so happens that the players at his current disposal don't fit his system ideally. Suso is a winger, and players like Laxalt and Ricardo Rodriguez are wing backs, not full backs. 

Giampaolo, on the other hand, likes his teams to play through the middle, and use hard working forwards who can move wide, drop deep and participate in the build-up play too. Angel Correa does all those things well. It just so happens that he's been converted into a photo winger by Simeone. 

Having Correa in that hard working forward role, and Paqueta in that creative controller in the middle is a far better fit than Silva or Cutrone. Should Milan shy away from taking Correa, and 'show faith in Cutrone' a player far too similar to Piatek, then there's a reasonable possibility that Giampaolo's time at Milan will be short and disastrous. They've already shown faith by getting him Krunic and Bennacer, two unfashionable an little known names from the depths of Serie A, but ones who hold much promise. Now they must do the same with the bigger name also.

---

**Inter**

Inter have just hired Conte. He, cut off the same cloth as Mourinho, an Inter legend. One known for a quotes like ""It's not possible to eat in a $100 restaurant with $10 in your pocket."" Before he came in, he demanded that whichever club hires him be prepared to spend money to make sure he gets the players he wants, irrespective of the price. 

Now in charge, he's directed the club to get him Lukaku, who Manchester United have slapped an 80m price tag on. And a player who's only managed 20 league goals in a season *once* in his entire career. On paper, it might seem like foolishness. However, Conte knows his system better than anyone else. He had hardcore 4-4-fucking-2 English managers experimenting with the three man backline in his first season in charge in England. Wenger started dabbling in that system. 

He demanded Alonso, a little known left back from Fiorentina, and then turned him into a star at Chelsea. Victor Moses, a bottom half level winger, turned into a crucial member as a wingback in his team. And when he demanded demanded Dzeko in January last season, Chelsea gave him Giroud. Dzeko fired his team to the semi-final in the Champions League. 

Simply put, Inter wanted Conte badly, and were prepared to pay him massive sums to get him to coach Inter. They must now do everything possible to ensure he has the players he wants, even if it means overpaying for Lukaku and selling players he doesn't want on the cheap.

346,Cholo's obsession: Avoiding injuries[full article],"**Article from AS**

*****

The high number of muscle injuries last season, almost 50, has affected the distribution of workloads this preseason so that they do not occur again. Only Koke has picked up a problem at Segovia so far. 

There is a number that haunts Atlético and it's not that Griezmann's '7' now belongs to 19-year-old Portuguese João Félix for whom Benfica has been paid 127 million. The number is the ""almost 50"" muscle injuries that plagued the team throughout last season, causing regular matchday squads with only eleven outfield players. A hindrance that the red-and-white team has tried to correct with a return to the origins, the stay of two weeks in Los Angeles de San Rafael, to fix the physical aspects of the preseason as in the first seven years of Simeone, with the usual test tubes of ""Profe"" Ortega and with some added antidote to that particular number that makes the technical staff's hair stand up in the back of the neck. Almost 50. 

Avoiding it is one of the great obsessions with which Simeone has started this preseason with certain differences from the past. The first is workloads. During the two weeks of work in Segovia have been many players who have been absent in some training (Lemar, Kalinic ...) and then return to the next with absolute normality. Oblak missed several sessions with the group without the club reporting any injury or discomfort (but the goalkeeper, during the first week, only completed part of the session with the group, in the afternoon training) and Koke, like the Slovenian but in the second week. The  absence of the captain(Koke) was explained under discomfort in the thigh, and the phrase that seems already a common message, ""sharing workloads"". 

The first medical problem of the summer, although it was said loudly. Only Koke beyond the blow to the hip that Joao Felix suffered in Burgo de Osma, against Numancia, which forced him to come off in minute 27, and which has nothing to do with the ghost that Cholo fears so much, muscle injuries &amp; the number 50. There have been changes in the physio-team, with Ortega promoting Daniel Castro to be part of his group, alongside Carlos Menéndez. They have had results so far. The only blow have been those muscle aches of Koke (who was not called for the game against Numancia but did travel to the U.S. tour).

Welcome to the triumphant return of the Premier League Previews, a series where a fan gives an overview of his team for your perusal, and I get an excuse to take pot-shots at other clubs. This will run until the eve of the Premier League, taking a look at each club in turn. Today we're breaking out the webbed feet to investigate the fens of Norfolk with **Norwich City.**

Last season couldn't have gone better for us. After a shaky start, and doubts surrounding Daniel Farke and Stuart Webber's futures at Norwich, it suddenly clicked and went absolutely brilliantly. The Leeds matches are great examples of this, where we went from them playing us off the pitch, with a score of 3-0, to absolutely dominating them at Elland Road. The same can be said with the Ipswich matches, in the fixture at the start of the season, at Portman Road, we scraped a 1-1 draw, with fans chanting ""Farke, sort it out"" and ""We want Farke out"".

The magic of Stuart Webber and his scouting team cannot be underestimated. Teemu Pukki, a lad who failed in Scotland went on to score 29 league goals, from a free transfer. Emi Buendia, the 5'7"" magician who ran rings against almost every Championship defense, £1.5 million. Add Christoph Zimmermann, a player who 4 years ago was playing for Borussia Dortmund II, preparing to write university applications to give up being a footballer. He's now one of the main captains for a Premier League side.

We were the team to beat last season. Let's see how it goes this time.

###**This Season** 
 
This season will be interesting, but I can't wait. It's only a few weeks away, and although I'll sadly miss the Liverpool match because I'm away, I'll be watching the score like a hawk. I can't see us getting relegated if we play the way we did last season, and in a few season's time could see us pushing for top 7.

**3 players to watch out for**  
 
[](#icon-star-big) **Emi Buendia**

This kid. Whoa boy. He is 5'7"" of man heaven. He'll be running rings around *a lot* of defenses this season. And he's just signed a 5-year contract with us. Keep your eye on the next Messi.

[](#icon-star-big) **Teemu Pukki**

I can not believe this man's story. His career seemed over, he was a waste of space and shouldn't have been a footballer. Then he transferred to us on a free. His first season of English Football, he scored 29 goals in the EFL Championship alone. This is the redemption story of a lifetime.
 
[](#icon-star-big) **Patrick Roberts**

Even though he's only been here a bit from Man City, he's looked quality, especially in the Schalke 04 game. Although there is a bit of competition for that spot with Emi, I reckon when he's on the pitch, he'll do well.

*I have more fear of second season syndrome. Think our team spirit and cause we haven't lost any of our rising stars means we finish around 13th*

*I think as long as we don’t put too much pressure on ourselves and have the right attitude we can stay up. 16th.*

###Wrap Up
by /u/NickTM
 
-
 
**The Manager:** Young German **Daniel Farke** kickstarted his career and revitalised Norwich's promotion ambitions last season, using his first season to consolidate and refresh before taking the league by storm in his second. Under his coaching Norwich produced some quite attractive football, and it's likely they'll try to maintain that creativity and commitment to going forward even in the Premier League.
 
**The Team:** In stark contrast to yesterday's team, Norwich have amassed a young side with few names retained from their last stint in the Premier League. Jamal Lewis and particularly the highly-rated Max Aarons - the latter being so disgustingly young he was born in the 21st century - both offered width and energy from full-back whilst Emi Buendia was a playmaking revelation. That's not to say they're all kids, though: some of you might remember Tim/ms Krul and Klose in goal and central defence respectively, whilst Josip Drmic should be familiar to Bundesliga fans as he looks to recreate the form that had Leverkusen shelling out for him. Teemu Pukki's fairytale continues up front, and Northern Irish cult hero Michael McGovern is apparently backup goalkeeper; who knew?
 
**Why to like them:** Until recently, it seemed like every single person involved in the running of Norwich City had significant meme potential, from owner [Delia Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXM6BOXBCIc) to chairman Ed ""Ed [""Twitter's Ed Balls""](https://twitter.com/edballs/status/63623585020915713?lang=en) Balls"" Balls. Sadly, the latter has stepped down as chairman, but he's still around as vice-president so it's not all doom and gloom. Elsewhere, a vibrant young squad offers a lot to like on the pitch, and Daniel Farke's name is sure to bring a whole lot of really overdone puns.
 
**Why to dislike them:** You might have been hoping for another team that hasn't been up recently to take a Prem berth, which I suppose is fair. Slightly more petty is wanting them to do badly so the angry people from /r/scottishfootball with a chip on their collective shoulders don't start yelling about how Teemu Pukki failed in Scotland and thus by transitive property the SPL isn't that bad, *ackshually*, you fucking Saxons.

**Summary:** Norwich have undergone quite a change since last being in this position, and it's nice to see. The name Norwich City often brings with it a hint of the English clogger types, but this time round they look anything but, and could prove a real surprise package. With that said, a little attention needs to be paid to their defence. Aarons and Lewis are both fine players, but their forays forward can leave the defence a little exposed and it's unlikely Pukki's goal return will be so high as to paper over those defensive cracks as effectively as it worked out last season.",soccer,1563882025,NickTM,55,197,True,2019-07-23

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but figured i'd start here. I'm hoping to pick your brains to make our competition better.

It's a simple game between 3 fans who support the same team. Each game, as the team sheets arrive, we have to guess the correct score and first goalscorer.

If you get the correct score it's 2 points
If you get the correct scorer it's 2 points
If you predict the correct result, i.e. I say it's 2-0 and it's a 1-0, you get 1 point.

Can you think of a better way in regards to points distribution or bonus points awarded for the upcoming season?

We have ran this for 2 seasons already and it does work. Just wondering if you can make it better?

##[](#sprite1-p265) Vasco da Gama [2x1](https://youtu.be/3tUlLN9gRN8) Fluminense [](#sprite1-p228)
[](#icon-ball) *45’+1: Pedro (FLU); 66’: Leandro Castán (VAS); 75’: Bruno César (VAS).*

**Vasco da Gama turn the derby around after Fluminense’s 2 red cards.**

Coming into the derby, both teams slipped up in their respective last round games. Vasco opened up the score against Grêmio, but ended up losing 2x1 at Porto Alegre; Fluminense also got ahead of Ceará, but the visitors fought their way into a tie. This year’s *Time de Guerreiros* record against their rivals is subpar to say the least, a single victory in nine occasions. To make matters worse, they haven’t won against *Trem Bala da Colina* for the past 2 years (8 matches: 2 draws, 6 defeats). This time it looked like Flu was finally breaking the curse, striker Pedro got his mojo back and scored once again facing Vasco. But things went south fast, captain Digão received a second yellow and was sent off right by the start of the second half, Vasco plucked one in not long after. Then it was time for Digão’s replacement on the pitch, centre-back Frazan, to be sent off. The hosts took the lead from the consequent free-kick. Vanderlei Luxemburgo keeps impressing with this Vasco da Gama squad, making them a tough opponent again. On the other side of the ring, Fluminense are left to pick up the pieces after two major blunders. The *tricolores* play midweek for the Copa Sulamericana round-of-16, an encounter with Atlético Peñarol in Uruguay. The *vascaínos* only return to action for their Brasileirão’s next round match.

##[](#sprite2-p480) Bahia 0x0 Cruzeiro [](#sprite1-p196)
[](#icon-red-ball)

**Despite a first half sending off, Bahia and Cruzeiro draw in low key affair.**

Both clubs had a midweek fixture in the Copa do Brasil quarter-finals, though the results were opposite. Bahia couldn’t make their home pressure pay off and lost 1x0 to Grêmio, Cruzeiro had such a large advantage from the first leg that the 2x0 defeat to rivals Atlético Mineiro wasn’t enough to steal *Raposa*’s spot in the semi-finals. Those events reflected in the teams pickings for the match, *Esquadrão de Aço* fielded a strong XI looking for a bounce back while the visitors put out a fully rotated squad, with a number of young prospects in the line-up. Even though this could mean a relatively easy match for the hosts, it was Cruzeiro who had the better half, with one or another chance to open the score. The highlight of those 45 minutes was winger Arthur Caike’s second yellow and subsequent sending off. Again defying expectations, if you thought that Cruzeiro would consolidate a lead, you’d be wrong. Bahia came back stronger and, despite being a man down, dictated the ways of the match. A shame that neither team cracked the score. The *baianos* return to the four lines in their next week’s match for the Brasileiro. Before returning to Brasileirão action, *Raposa* have a tough clash against Argentina’s River Plate in the Copa Libertadores round-of-16.

##[](#sprite1-p190) Internacional [1x1](https://youtu.be/N0Nq20EZE8k) Grêmio [](#sprite1-p130)
[](#icon-ball) *21’: Paulo Miranda (INT/OG); 70’: Luan (GRE).*

**Internacional and Grêmio split half performances and arrive at a draw in the Beira-Rio.**

Coming into the biggest *clássico* in the country, both Grêmio and Inter had success in their midweek clashes. *Colorado* had a dream match against Palmeiras, where the players and supporters went through heaven and hell, but ended up through to the Copa do Brasil semi-finals. *Imortal* had a more low key affair, travelling away to Salvador and coming back home with a spot in the semi-finals as well. The one problem for this derby was the line-up from both teams, the two have another match during the middle of this week and therefore rested key players to preserve their fitness. Inter had one or two starters on the pitch, while Grêmio put out a complete reserve team. The lack of synergy showed throughout the match, with both teams having problems when creating chances. Inter were better in the first half and deserved the partial victory. But things turned around in the final half, Grêmio lit up and started to pile chances. Attacking midfielder Luan scored the equalizing goal and tied with, now his manager, Renato Gaúcho on Grêmio’s all time top scorers (74 goals). Anyhow, the affair was low key one. Like all Grenais, had its share of [fondness displayed from opposing players](https://imgur.com/WZaYBLM). Both *gaúchos* play for CONMEBOL Libertadores during this midweek. Internacional will travel to Uruguay and face Nacional, while Grêmio will host Paraguay’s Libertad.

##[](#sprite4-p346) Ceará [2x0](https://youtu.be/UyJwLd7Kxi8) Palmeiras [](#sprite1-p142)
[](#icon-ball) *31’: Mateus Gonçalves (CEA); 71’: Leandro Carvalho (CEA).*

**Ceará surprise the entire competition by ending the 33-games unbeaten streak of leaders Palmeiras.**

Both teams came from draws in the last round. Ceará with Fluminense, and Palmeiras with rivals São Paulo. But before heading into this match, *Porco* had a meeting with Internacional in the Copa do Brasil quarter-finals, which they lost on normal time and penalties, being knocked out from the competition. To avoid any further pressure on his job, manager Felipão decided to field a stronger side than expected for this match, to match Ceará’s strongest XI. Out of all teams to pick for ending Palmeiras’ unworldly run in the Brasileiro, *Vozão* were ones of the unlikeliest to be chosen. But so they did, and by a two goal margin nonetheless. To get some things out of the way, brief remarks about the VAR intervention (and lack of) during the match. On Ceará’s first goal, a possible foul wasn’t called for *Porco* in the origin of the play, an instance where the video wasn’t checked. And later, a penalty for Palmeiras was called off after the referee's review of the possible foul. However this doesn’t excuse the below par showing by the Brasileirão leaders. The *cearenses* are buzzing after such an excellent result, hopefully they bring this form onwards to their next match, in the Campeonato Brasileiro 12^th round. Before playing for the league, Palmeiras travel to Argentina for a meeting against Godoy Cruz for the Copa Libertadores round-of-16.

##[](#sprite9-p8) CSA [0x4](https://youtu.be/2H-fxKIsjqA) Athletico Paranaense [](#sprite1-p443)
[](#icon-ball) *41’: Madson (CAP); 59’: Thonny Anderson (CAP); 85’: Léo Cittadini (CAP); 90’+2: Braian Romero (CAP).*

**Despite playing second string players, Athletico Paranaense thrash CSA.**

CSA returned home from a nerve-racking 1x0 defeat to Corinthians, while Athletico skipped over Internacional’s reserves with a slim 1x0 victory. The *paranaenses* fielded a B team for the match because of their midweek clash with Flamengo in the Copa do Brasil quarter-finals, another 1x1 draw but a marvellous win on the penalty shootout. Any help is necessary for *Azulão*, the club returned to Brazil’s top tier league after more than 30 years away from it and the lack of numerous factors isn’t helping their cause. The *alagoanos* proved toothless on the offence and in shambles on the defence, conceding 3 goals from headers. *Fhuracão*’s reserves took advantage of the northeasterners lack of practice under their new coach and thrived on that Saturday night. A match to put behind for CSA, as their struggles against relegation are thickening each round. *Azulão* only return to action a week from now, for the Campeonato Brasileiro. Athletico Paranaense have a midweek fixture for the Copa Libertadores round-of-16, yet another match against Boca Juniors from Argentina.

##[](#sprite1-p261) Botafogo [0x1](https://youtu.be/8Oivk5dY-qk) Santos [](#sprite1-p187)
[](#icon-ball) *74’: Marinho (SAN).*

**Santos strike a wondergoal to spoil hosts Botafogo’s sunday morning.**

This match put up against each other two teams in the top half of the table, but in opposites form. Botafogo had a snoozefest against Cruzeiro in the last round, while Santos grabbed a hard fought win against Bahia in Salvador. Once touted as relegation candidates, Botafogo had a strong start with new manager Eduardo Barroca, but recent form is troubling so far. And on the other side of the clash, Santos’s performance in the Brasileirão came from left field but the work being done with Sampaoli speaks for itself. After a half of not much going on, the second half started popping with Santos centre-back sending off. Unfortunately, Fogo couldn’t capitalize on their number advantage and not long after right-back Gilson was also sent off with a second yellow. From then on, *Peixe* got on top of things and ruled the match. The deadlock was only broken after a belter, a golazo, a screamer, a Puskas contender by winger Marinho, a goal so great it was [named, by himself, a random mini missile](https://twitter.com/globoesportecom/status/1152975273039732739). Santos remain in absolute top form at the moment and are now tied in points for first place with rivals Palmeiras, they return to action next week for the Brasileiro. Botafogo have a midweek affair with Atlético Mineiro for the Copa Sulamericana round-of-16.

##[](#sprite1-p201) Atlético Mineiro [2x2](https://youtu.be/QKBaE-s_d2I) Fortaleza [](#sprite5-p7)
[](#icon-ball) *7’: Juninho (CAM/OG); 12’: Cazares (CAM); 66’: Carlinhos (FOR); 71’: Juninho (FOR).*

**In a heated dispute, Fortaleza cling back a draw against Atlético Mineiro.**

Both teams came from victories in the last round. Atlético Mineiro sent a B team to face Chapecoense in southern Brazil and came back home with the 3 points after a 2x1 turn around, Fortaleza brushed Avaí aside playing in front of their home crowd in the Castelão with a solid 2x0. Unfortunately for *Galo*, despite a 2x0 win against rivals Cruzeiro, they ended up eliminated from the Copa do Brasil. This meant a stronger starting line-up for Atlético in this match, with only some players getting a rest. During the Copa América break, player [Adílson Warken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C3%ADlson_Warken) had to retire from football after uncovering a cardiac problem. He was one game away from the symbolic 100 mark, [so Atlético Mineiro had him kick-off this match](https://twitter.com/globoesportecom/status/1153020689567424513). Anyway, busy match, lots to catch on. The game kinda split halves, with *Galo* being dominant in the first one while *Leão* fighting back in the second. This reflects in the goals scored, two by a team in each half. Juninho scored a worldie of an own goal and this had a clear impact on the northeastern team morale for the first 45 minutes. Atlético had nothing to do with it and kept attacking, feeding of their last performances. Come the final 45 minutes and Fortaleza were back on their game, firing two goals to draw level. One last important event of highlight was keeper Felipe Alves two penalty saves (VAR in Brazil is wild at the moment), making manager Rogério Ceni ecstatic and sealing the draw for his team. Before returning to Brasileiro action, the *mineiros* have an encounter with Botafogo for the Copa Sulamericana round-of-16. Fortaleza only return to the pitch a week from now, for the Campeonato Brasileiro. On a final note, [good luck on your future adventures, Adílson](https://imgur.com/4XqnI6E).

[](#icon-ball) *61’: Clayson (COR); 90’: Gabriel Barbosa (FLA).*

**Corinthians and Flamengo end up drawing.**

The two clubs won their last outings in the Campeonato Brasileiro, albeit with very different scorelines. Corinthians triumphed against CSA’s parked tractor by a slick 1x0, while Flamengo thumped Goiás badly with an unforgettable 6x1. The *cariocas* played a match midweek though, a 1x1 draw with Athletico Paranaense in the Copa do Brasil quarter-finals, with a subsequent loss on the pen shootout. Returning to the *Clássico das Multidões*, it subverted expectations. *Timão* had control for large stretches of the game, with a solid first half where they were closer than Mengo to pulling ahead. Throughout the week, it was much discussed as to how the match was going to be an attack versus defence, but certainly not in this order with Corinthians pressing Flamengo. By the second half, the *paulistas* actually had their efforts paid off and opened up the score. However this lead to the previous scenario which was theorized for the game, *Mengão* attacking and *Timão* defending. This cat and mouse game ended with a late goal from the competition’s top goal scorer Gabigol, already his 8^th in the championship. Both teams have midweek fixtures, but for different tournaments. Corinthians face Uruguay’s Montevideo Wanderers in their Copa Sulamericana round-of-16 match, while Flamengo play Emelec in Ecuador for the Copa Libertadores round-of-16.

##[](#sprite2-p373) Avaí 0x0 Goiás [](#sprite2-p340)
[](#icon-red-ball)

**Avaí and Goiás make the snoozest of snoozefests. Maybe ever.**

Hosts Avaí returned home after another defeat in the competition, this time against Fortaleza in northeastern Brazil, while Goiás got systematically thrashed by Flamengo in their previous match. I’m one to say that the most beautiful matches come from the lowest quality available, but fucking Avaí and Goiás had to remind me how wrong I am. This match was bad, everything in it was bad, everything surrounding it was bad. To make my point *clear*, this game’s apex was [the new lighting in Avaí’s Estádio da Ressacada](https://twitter.com/AvaiFC/status/1153060934723756034). If you’re suffering from insomnia, give this match a go. Fuckity fuck. *Leão da Ilha* and *Esmeraldino* have no fixtures midweek, and return to play in Brasileirão next round.

##[](#sprite1-p101) São Paulo [4x0](https://youtu.be/UQRg4jMuUVg) Chapecoense [](#sprite4-p397)
[](#icon-ball) *48’: Antony (SAO); 52’: Toró (SAO); 55’: Raniel (SAO); 90’: Vitor Bueno (SAO).*

**São Paulo smash Chapecoense with incredible second half showing.**

Both teams had lukewarm showings returning from the Copa América break. São Paulo was having the time of their lives against rivals Palmeiras before the strange equalizing goal, which brought back the old São Paulo from early semester. Chapecoense had an absolute garbage result against Atlético Mineiro’s reserve, after getting ahead early the *catarinenses* gave up the ball and ended up losing the game in the dying minutes. Well, returning to this match in question. The first half was pretty much in control from *Soberano*, with some chances of goal and overall good presence in the attacking third. *Verdão do Oeste* did have a nice chance to open the score with Everaldo, but São Paulo keeper Tiago Volpi saved with his foot. The real kicker happens in half time, manager Cuca does one more of his crazy shenanigans and attempts a double substitution. It paid off big, with winger Everton (though playing through the middle!) and winger Toró playing important parts in the *Tricolor Paulista*’s goals. After an incredible comeback from half time, São Paulo retracted and maintained their lead. Chape had a debatable goal disallowed, but that’d be pettiness. After the superb showing, the *paulistas* will have a week to rest. So does Chapecoense, but with a lot on their minds. Both teams only return to action for the Brasileirão’s next round.

The highlighted games are considered the *ones to watch*.

The schedule is in **BRT** *(Brasília Time / Brazil Time)*.

##But why should you check out those matches?
A duel between teams in opposite sides of the league table, [](#sprite1-p228) **Fluminense x São Paulo** [](#sprite1-p101) promises to be a hard fought match. Fluminense, in the moment, are in one of the relegation spots and a reaction is much needed for the squad, especially after another derby defeat. São Paulo is steadily coming to grips with their new manager’s playstyle, and early signs are looking good for the *paulistas*, a draw against rivals (and top of the league) Palmeiras and a thumping against Chapecoense, all after the Copa América break. This clash puts in front of each other a team which is hungry for ball possession against one of the league’s lethal counters, an interesting debate between footballing ideas. If *Time de Guerreiros* are to stand their ground, star striker **Pedro** has to be on his best. That because goalkeeper **Tiago Volpi** is doing bits for *Tricolor Paulista* hopes of a victorious season.

Two clubs riding on a streak of bad results, [](#sprite4-p397) **Chapecoense x Bahia** [](#sprite2-p480) could be one team’s turn for redemption. After surviving relegation in the last round of 2018’s Brasileirão, Chapecoense had a tall order of improving their performance for this season. Despite a good amount of signings, *Verdão do Oeste* still hasn’t shown improvement from last year’s performance, relying almost entirely on their new main man **Everaldo** to grab them points in order to survive relegation. Things don’t look as grim for Bahia, but the club suffered a setback and lost momentum after the games for the Copa do Brasil quarter-finals, truth is they had a tough run of fixtures and the poor results show that. To imprint their more successful style in the season, *Esquadrão de Aço* will count with defensive midfielder **Gregore** superb dispossessing skills to counter their way into victory away from home.

Where on earth can I find size 15 Cleats that won't empty our savings account?  I played a little back in the day, but I was allowed to wear baseball cleats since there was no such thing as a size 16 soccer cleat back in the early 90's that we could find.

The state athletic association says they can't wear baseball or football cleats. This was obviously my initial solution. They can't have metal cleats, and there can't be a toe cleat, although they apparently will allow it to be ground down if there is one.

152,FMcouter: A Google Chrome Extension that allows you to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a soccer player,"Hello, Redditors out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I built a Google Chrome Extension named **&lt;FMcouter&gt;** that allows you to find out the advantages and disadvantages of a soccer player using massive amounts of Football Manager (FM) data.

&amp;#x200B;

To learn about players that you are unfamiliar with, you usually need to search them up on Google or look for highlight videos. You can also find out the advantages or disadvantages of a player simply through how they are rated on soccer games, but this is also impossible if the game is not installed in your computer.

&amp;#x200B;

This Chrome extension allows you to browse the profile of a player summarized based on the data in Football Manager, which is considered to be the game that reflects the players' abilities pretty accurately.

&amp;#x200B;

I developed this extension for fun and for experimental purposes. It may contain some bugs, but I hope you can use it to get a better understanding of players that you are not familiar with.

211,Scout Report [2019-07-13],"Welcome to your thread dedicated to scouting some slightly less well known players. Whether it’s a young
prospect at your club that you want to bring to other’s attention or an older head from a team most won’t
normally watch that you think is the next Jamie Vardy.

For those of you that are unsure how to approach it, here’s a guideline of stuff that you may want to include
(feel free to add or change according to how you see fit though):

**Games watched** - Just a little description of what they’re basing their judgment on Basic info of the player -
age, nationality, height etc.

**Stats** - Games played, goals, whatever and source for things that aren’t basic
like some of the stuff whoscored.com provides. Description of current role within team. What are his
primary responsibilities? What does he allow other players to do?

**Strengths/weaknesses**

**Summary** - Can be where he’s at now, his potential, any discussion about tactical fits etc. If some sort of
grade is included, give a key every time, because it won’t mean the same thing to everybody

This thread is really for players that not everyone will be familiar with, so please try and encourage those
giving insight to players you’ve not heard of before.

So im from germany, and in our stadions, whenever a player gets substituted or scores a goal , the whole stadion keeps calling the last name of the Player.
So for example, if Kingsley Coman gets Substituted for Robert Lewandowski, the stadion caster Shouts „Robert“ and then the whole stadion goes „lewandowski“ .
I noticed that on international Level, No other Country Does that.

277,Rule change proposal to protect creative players,"Maradonna once said in an interview that players like Messi should be protected by the referees, and many people laughed at the idea that some players should get special treatment.

However, I propose that it is in some regard a pretty good idea, if you take some small adjustments.

If you watch some highlights from the clasicos between Real and Barca between 2008-2013, you will notice that Reals go to tactic to stop Messi is fouling him, and by rotating the fouling player, they dodge a lot of cards.

Same goes for Neymar during the 2014 World Cup, or these days players like Mbappe or Salah. If a coach and a defense run out of ideas to defend a player, they will commit to fouling him as often as possible. We judge players like Neymar or Ronaldo for diving, but anyone who has played football knows how frustrating it is when you are fouled continously.

I think that defensive football is about more than taking the best player out by commiting assaults and risking the possibility of a career ending injury, so how can we implement a measure that prohibits teams to use fouls as their go to measure?

Implement a rule that a team is only allowed to foul any certain player in the opposing team a margin of times, lets say for example 5 times. The player who commits the 5th foul on one specific player gets a straight red card, independent of the severity of the foul. Also, implement a rule of a maximum allowed number of fouls a team can commit before the opposing team gets a penalty (inspiration from the NBA).

This prevents fouling from being a valuebale asset in defending while still being an option, minimizes the risk of creative players from suffering injuries, and takes refereeing to team oriented level.",soccer,1563022069,Dalucard21,78,0,True,2019-07-13

367,Serbian Superliga Preview 2019/20," 

The Linglong Serbian Superliga, sponsored by a Chinese tyre company building a plant in the north of Serbia, is going to be won by Crvena Zvezda. There’ll probably be a couple of match-fixing allegations, a bunch of players not getting paid, some top young talent, a walk-off after a contentious decision, some terrible decisions made to [allow games to carry on](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DuikWieXcAAamO4?format=jpg&amp;name=small) and the sort of scandal more befitting of a trashy soap opera than what is supposed to be a professional football league. And that’s, ultimately, why we love it – it’s unpredictable and full of talking points, even if a great many of those talking points aren’t exactly positive.

Even before the league starts, that sort of thing has been going on. Take Simo Krunic, Radnicki Nis’ new manager. At the end of last season, his Cukaricki side ended his new employers’ title ambitions in a game where he attempted to fight the Radnicki Nis coaching staff, ending with police having to separate the two coaching teams and then gave a press conference about how much he was Zvezda supremo Zvezdan Terzic’s best friend. Don’t even mention the stuff around the national manager’s job. This sort of thing is just an accepted part of daily life in Serbian football.

But out of the madness must come a functioning football season and, to give it it’s due, Serbian football has delivered of late. While many will look on Zvezda’s CL appearance last season as evidence, it was merely a follow up to Europa League goodness from both they and from Partizan the season prior. The players being produced are moving for closer to their value than before, players such as Dejan Joveljic or Filip Stuparevic, when they go abroad and last season’s title race went almost all the way with the relegation race being even more exciting, not to mention an eventful relegation playoff.

So when looking ahead to this season, there seems plenty to be encouraged by when it comes to what entertainment the season will provide. Ultimately, however, only one team is going to win it.

Crvena Zvezda are that rare thing in Serbia – a relatively well-run club. They are the dominant side in Serbia not because of shadiness but because they have invested their money better, kept their over-performing manager and brought in some really very good players. Of the players they’ve lost over the summer, only Goran Causic is of great detriment – Joveljic is the major sale monetarily and for the future, but in a position the club had well covered and, while he is an excellent player who will serve Eintracht well, he moved before he truly became an indispensable member of the team. Tomane is a promising replacement as back up striker as, ultimately, in Milan Pavkov and Aleksa Vukanovic, Zvezda have two domestic strikers who are more than capable of providing the firepower to take them to the title even without the input of more lauded players such as El Fardou Ben or Richmond Boakye. Much of that is that sitting behind that forward line is the rejuvenated Marko Marin.

Marin has had a stuttering career, mainly due to an ill fated move to Chelsea, but he swaggers around the Superliga a class apart from any other player in the league. His team are, likewise, a class apart from any other side in the league. They went most of last season unbeaten and, while the team is no better now than then, one could expect them to be on a similar roll this season. They simply have too much talent on the pitch and in the dugout to not win the league convincingly.

Neutrals will undoubtedly think “but what about Partizan?” Certainly, towards the end of last season under Savo Milosevic, there was something approaching a revival to what Partizan should be doing but it’s hard to avoid the issues that the club has around money and a sign of that was the cheap as chips sale of Svetozar Markovic to Olympiacos - recently he was one of the most highly rated under 20 centre backs in football, now he’s away to Greece for under £1.5m without his talent or potential having changed. His replacement, Igor Vucanic, impressed in Montenegrin football but Montenegrin football is a terrible standard and his move to Serbia, particularly to Partizan, is a sign of where Partizan’s ambitions (or lack of) are. Rajko Brezancic is a decent signing but I’m fairly sure that I’ll have a fair portion of Scottish readers laughing merely by mentioning the name of Partizan’s loan signing: Umar Sadiq, who was uniquely terrible in Scotland. Likely their most promising piece of business was in bringing in Aleksandar Lutovac from Rad - Lutovac was overdue a move to a bigger club and if he hits the ground running at Partizan, he should have a big impact.

But being entirely honest, this Partizan side doesn’t have what it takes to hang with Zvezda. Stojkovic is an unreliable goalkeeper, there’s a reliance on throwing kids into the side with the appropriate varying levels of success (Strahinja Pavlovic is the main man at the minute, but last season, Partizan were putting out a CB partnership with a combined age of 36) and we’ll see that from the likes of Derlek, Pavlovic (x2 - Strahinja and Lazar) and Stevanovic all so they can get sold to maintain being able to pay the rest of the side. As and when Partizan get themselves on a sound footing with some stability, then they will be able to look to build towards a title challenge. Those conditions are not currently at the club.

For a start, Partizan weren’t even second last season - that was Radnicki Nis. As mentioned earlier, there’s been a change of manager at the club with Simo Krunic coming in. With that has come plenty of player turnover - five first team regulars have gone over the summer (when including loans) and they will be extremely reliant on the goals of Nermin Haksic to fire them to a decent place in the league. The replacements that have come in aren’t exciting and the measure of how good they are was seen in the embarrassing 2-0 first leg defeat to Flora Tallinn in the Europa League - a team they’d have been expected to beat relatively comfortably.

So, if the Nisave aren’t up to putting together a season to break up the big two, who is? Well, the mastermind of Radnicki Nis’ great season last year, Nenad Lalatovic, is now Vojvodina manager. Vojvodina are traditionally Serbia’s third club but have endured a torrid few seasons. Lalatovic represents the best hope of turning the club around and he’s been given free rein to reshape the squad with nine players coming into the club this summer. NIkola Drincic, brought directly with him from Radnicki Nis is still a top central midfielder at this level as is Petar Bojic. Nemanja Covic had a good season last year with Proleter and was well worth the move. Jovan Kokir may also turn out to be a stroke of genius - he did well enough on loan last season in the Prva Liga and if Lalatovic goes all in on him, it may well pay off handsomely. Better players have come in than gone out and while any hope of a challenge to Zvezda seems fanciful, if Vojvodina can get themselves into the top four and into European competition for next season, the season will have been a success.

There are two other clubs who will have aspirations similar to Vojvodina’s. The first of those is last year’s fourth-placed Cukaricki who lost manager Simo Krunic but brought in Aleksandar Veselinovic. Veselinovic messed up at Vojvodina but on his time at Spartak, there’s little reason to think he’ll do badly. Last season’s side has been kept together with Veljko Birmancevic making his move permanent. Ognjen Mudrinski is the main loss from the side but Mink Peeters is nothing if not an intriguing replacement and there appears to be a more prominent role for homegrown Slobodan Tedic, who scored a Europa League double against Banants. It’s fair to say using the limited Europa League form, Cukaricki seem better prepared for this season than Radnicki Nis.

The other club worth mentioning when it comes to European qualification are newly promoted TSC Backa Topola (some call them TSC, some Backa Topola - it’s confusing. Hopefully, we’ll have agreed naming by the end of the season). They won the Prva Liga by five points in what was a competitive race against Javor (who had been relegated the previous season) and are backed, similarly to some clubs in other nations, by Hungarian money that is part of Orban’s soft power imperialism in Hungarian ethnic regions. TO be fair to them, they do not really flaunt their cash or the ethnic angle that much but have made some sensible acquisitions - Goran Antonic was a good Superliga player when leaving to go abroad and comes back a better player, Janko Tumbasevic is a solid Superliga midfielder who had a great season at Mladost last season. They add to a side that was extremely potent last season and whose policy was to produce the best possible Prva Liga side. There’s no reason why that shouldn’t be transferrable to the Superliga as TSC were the best Prva Liga winners for a little while with a +53 goal difference. It would be a surprise were they not to finish in the top eight and, with a little more investment, getting to the top four might not be beyond them.

Outside of those six, the race is on around the bubble of the top/bottom eight. The format of the Superliga is that after each team has played each other home and away, the league splits in two with points halving - each side plays each other once more to bring you to the end. As such, getting into the top eight is a big achievement as it ensures your team won’t be in any bother when it comes to relegation. There are five sides who will fit into this category.

Promoted Javor came second behind TSC last season but that doesn’t mean they are outsiders. Given the nature of some of the sides that’ll be pointed out as fighting relegation, they should set their ambitions that little bit higher given that, in any other season, they would have convincingly won the Prva Liga - they scored four or more in games seven times last season and Ivan Markovic was that league’s top scorer last term. The business they have done has been to improve the side defensively and with their potency not in doubt along with many players still holdovers from their previous Superliga stint such as Eliomar, they should fit back in fairly well.

Napredak fell away in the second half of last season after the loss of Aleksa Vukanovic and new manager Predrag Rogan has to find a way to get them firing quickly. To do so, however, all he has been able to bring in are veterans Jovan Markoski and Tomislav Pajovic. After sixth and seventh in the past two seasons, expect this to be the one where they drop out of the top eight.

The Uranium Boys, Mladost Lucani, have been a secure mid-table side in the Superliga for the past five years and have followed every season in the top eight with a season in the bottom eight. They were fifth last season so logic would tend to dictate that they shouldn’t reach the top eight this year. That said, they welcome back Bogdan Milosevic after a year in France and Ivan Obrovac is as experienced as they come. They should break that one in, one out spell of seasons due to the fallings of others.

Proleter were that eighth side last season and spent most of the year ahead of city rivals Vojvodina. There is unlikely to be a repeat of that - Covic and Lambulic are big losses and it is difficult to see them retaining their top half place this time around. There are worse sides so they shouldn’t be looking at a relegation fight, however.

The last side on this bubble are Vozdovac. They were, if anything, a little disappointing last season and have had massive upheaval this summer. Filip Stuparevic is now gone for good along with key midfielders Andrija Lukovic and Lazar Arsic. Rade Kokovic has not got much of a positive record in his managerial roles to date either. They do welcome back Nemanja Nikolic (not that one) and Justas Lasickas could be a marvellous signing but it’s fair to expect a poor start to the season followed by a revival late on.

This leaves everyone else looking over their shoulders. The Superliga has two automatic relegation places with third bottom going into a playoff. After defeating the terrible, if [incessantly entertaining](https://twitter.com/timomouse/status/1131301252581736449), Dinamo Vranje in a playoff, Indija join the Superliga. There have been minimal reinforcements and they are undoubtedly favourites to go down.

The remaining sides are Rad, Radnik, Spartak and Macva. Rad have lost two good players in Lutovac and Bainovic but the club is built around the youth system and there is a fair likelihood that someone else will be promoted to the first team to make up for it - Njegos Petrovic is the obvious name to benefit, but Branko Riznic and Dejan Paradjina may come through to compensate. Either way, last season was disastrous for the club and they will not get away with a seven month streak without a win again.

Macva were solid last season and Nikola Dukic is a promising addition at left back as is Filip Cermelj but they rely on both kicking on. Radnik have lost players and come in weaker than last season by some margin. Spartak have lost a key piece of their puzzle in Nemanja Glavcic but Vladimir Gacinovic (father of Mijat) is wily enough to keep them safe. Of the four, Rad would be the favourites for relegation given their form last season and that they have lost their best player.

The Superliga starts next week on Friday 19th with Vozdovac vs TSC with game week two bringing a clash between last season’s top two at Rajko Mitic as Zvezda take on Radnicki Nis. Highlights are uploaded on the [Superliga Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperligaSrbija) site on the day of the games so it’s very easy to keep track with what’s going on, even if much of the extra-curricular stuff requires far more immersion to get one’s head around.",soccer,1563033471,loveisokay,7,52,True,2019-07-13

Unfortunately, this means that title is inaccurate: **Brazil have lost 5 (not 4) competitive home internationals**, and **the last South American national team to win a competitive match in Brazil was Peru at the 1975 Copa América** (and not Uruguay at the 1950 World Cup).

Unfortunately, I can't edit the incorrect title, but I've corrected the table below, and hopefully the information will still be of interest.  Thanks to /u/GreatSpaniard for pointing out the correct information!

I know it was brought up and the clips I saw just had the commentators basically say ""oh yes, and she is inside as we can see there"" without showing footage of it clearly being inside. From all the other controversial offsides calls where offsides was called after VAR (Cameroon's and Englands's) they showed the image from the field with the artificial line drawn in where you can much easier see of they got the call correct. But I never saw any footage of them doing this and tracing out the line of who was closest to the goal  for that goal against France. I tried pausing it myself on my TV and it just isnt clear enough for me.

274,Var and Offside,"(I’ve held the opinion for a while but decided to share it in light of the discussion regarding the England USA game)


I feel that VAR misses the point a bit. 

In football when ‘offside’ rules were created they were created to prevent goal hanging. In the past 50 years or so, the general ruling with offside given by linesmen has been to give the benefit of the doubt to the attacker. 


I feel that judging players by tiny millimetres is wrong, when the frame they choose might not even have been the one when the ball has left a players foot. If you are going to use technology that judges by the millimetres, everything else has to be perfect, choice of frame, positioning of cameras, etc. 


I’m not suggesting a solution at all and understand, u can’t say “5cm is an acceptable level of offside but 5.1 isn’t”.

301,Were England Cheated by a Bad VAR Decision?,"Here is the VAR image that should show the position of Ellen White and the U.S. defenders at the moment the ball was played forward. Notice the players are right on the edge of the dark grass/ light grass stripe.

Now look at this actual video at 56 seconds. Notice the moment the ball is played forward coincides with the Commentator saying ""Walsh"".  This means, for accuracy, we can play that section of the video several times watching the position of Ellen White and the defenders as the commentator says ""Walsh"". I think that shows Ellen White and the defenders were several feet into the light grass stripe as the ball was played. That would suggest the VAR image was not captured as the ball was played forward.

Ronaldo vs Khan 2002 WC final - basically the hype match up that determines who was going to win it all for their country. Khan had a great first half only to have a blunder in the 2nd, also was well and truly beaten for the 2nd goal.

CR7 vs Ashley Cole (many games) - a prime winger Ronaldo taking on Cole who was also a world class left back. Their clashes were great and physical, thou I seem to find that Ronaldo changed his position to the left wing later on so he didn't have to deal with Cole 😀

Thou not individual, but Baresi  vs Brazil's frontline of Romario, Bebeto etc in the 1994 WC final was superb. In the roaring heat
at the age of 34, he put on a world class defensive masterclass against an incredible attack. Shame that his performance is most likely overshadowed by his and Baggios penalty misses.

363,The stadium will be half empty at the final whistle of NED v SWE tonight (due to transit in Lyon),"Groupama is in the middle of nowhere 10km from city center. The stadium’s public transit leaving a game is really bad. Your only options are a slow tram or uber, you can’t walk. We waited 70 minutes to get on a tram back in a giant mosh of fans (and then 25 mins back to Part-Dieu in a hot crowded train car). 

***** It’s very poor planning that they couldn’t have had a few busses as well, I would have happily paid for a bus ride vs a 60 Euro uber. *****

So, why an empty stadium at the end of the game? You had probably 20 to 30k Americans at the game who likely, like us, bought tickets for both semi’s. There is no way we are staying to final whistle if it means dealing with the tram “queue” again. 

Finally, Groupama staff, your signage and staffing while leaving is very bad. Someone fainted in the mosh and there were zero staff any where nearby. And we could not we see or understand why the crowd couldn’t move forward (due to the lack of lights, signs and communication).

To fix this, I took some time to put together all his best plays at each stage of the journey. Hope one day we will get to see his goals and highlights in HD, but for now the video quality is what it is (the best I could find). My intent here is not to compare Baggio with other legends (vintage or contemporary), but rather explain why Italians love so much a player that has never won them anything.



&amp;#x200B;

**[Dealing with proper farmers in the 80s Italian Serie C](https://i.imgur.com/rPxt494.gifv)**

As a young lad he scored 110 goals in 120 matches for the Vicenza youth team.
Moved to the senior squad, and in 84–85 he scored 12 goals in 29 appearances.
Kid showed amazing football and the club got promoted to Serie B.
Then he got injured by shattering both the anterior cruciate ligament and the meniscus of his right knee.
Several team doctors feared he would not be able to play again.

Fiorentina (which finalised Baggio's transfer two days prior the injury) funded the required surgery.
Then a week after his Serie A debut he suffered from the another awful knee injury.
This time the operation required 220 stitches to have it rebuilt, making Baggio miss most of the season.
After missing the pitch for almost two years, he came back and scored his first league goal from a freekick in May 1987 in a 1–1 draw against Maradona's Napoli.
His equaliser saved Fiorentina from relegation.

&amp;#x200B;

**[They called him ""Fantasista""](https://i.imgur.com/SHVP30u.gifv)**

In 1988–89 season Baggio scored 15 goals in Serie A and 9 in Coppa Italia, helping Fiorentina finish 7th in the league.
Although the team was struggling against relegation the following year, Baggio led the club to the UEFA Cup final.
With 17 goals, Baggio was the second-highest scorer in the 89–90 season, only two goals behind Van Basten and in front of Maradona.
Then, a couple of months before the 1990 World Cup, Baggio was sold to Fiorentina's archenemy Juventus for the world record transfer at the time.
That was took particularly well by the gentlemen from Curva Fiesole, who rioted and trashed the streets of Florence.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Scoring Maradona-esque goals against Maradona's Napoli](https://i.imgur.com/lwFDm2O.gifv)**

In 1990 Baggio was called up for his first World Cup tournament.
Often used as a substitute he appeared in five matches, as Italy manager Vicini preferred Gianluca Vialli (who eventually underachieved).
Other than injuries, being prevailed by tactics and more promising players is a recurrent theme in Baggio's career.  

&amp;#x200B;

**[Displaying his ability during the 1990 WC, the few times he could actually play](https://i.imgur.com/hdaAmcD.gifv)**

He still managed to score twice, including the ""goal of the tournament"" in a 2–0 win in his first competitive international fixture. Italy only placed third in the end, but Baggio shined and his confidence got boosted.
In his first season at Juventus he introduced himself by scoring 14 goals and providing 12 assists.
Juventus reached the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup that year, a tournament in which Baggio was top scorer with 9 goals.
In his second season, under new manager Trapattoni, Baggio again finished runner-up to Marco van Basten for the Serie A top scorer title, with 18 goals and 8 assists.
Same in 92-93 when Baggio was once again runner-up with 21 goals and 6 assists (more than Batistuta for the second year in a row).

&amp;#x200B;

**[A generational talent was born](https://i.imgur.com/ZSCJPSi.gifv)**

Baggio managed a personal record of 39 goals across all competitions that year, he was also crucial to make Italy qualify for the '94 US World Cup.
His performances throughout the year earned him the 1993 Ballon d'Or.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Now imagine if he had both knees](https://i.imgur.com/nGZLC9e.gifv)**

In the 1993–94 season, Baggio often played as a second striker alongside Vialli, Ravanelli and the young Alessandro Del Piero.
Juventus finished runners up to Milan in Serie A, and Baggio finished third in the capocannoniere title with 17 goals and 8 assists behind Zola and Signori (who was a beast that year).
After sustaining another injury earlier that season, Baggio was operated on his meniscus in March 1994.
Then the World Cup came and even tho he was still recovering Baggio was expected to be one of the main stars.
He was entering the competition as the reigning Ballon d'Or winner and FIFA World Player of the year and at the peak of his career
After a weak start he led azzurri to the final against Brazil with three match winning performances in the knockout rounds and scoring five goals in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Baggio single-handedly dragging Italy to the WC final](https://i.imgur.com/ZnczW3a.gifv)**  

I can say with almost certainty that not a single Italian has ever blamed Baggio for losing against Brazil.
He brought an unconvincing side to the World Cup final with the greatest individual football azzurri have ever experienced and still couldn't save them in the end.
I'm sure Italy would have lost the shoot-out even if he managed to score (keep in mind that Baresi and Tassotti missed before him).
In a way we were ""destined"" to lose that game and I find poetic that it was up to him to end it with the only over-the-bar penalty of his career.
Just to put things in perspective, [Baggio's conversion rate from the penalty spot is one of the best of all time](https://barcanumbers.wordpress.com/2018/03/27/the-best-penalty-takers-of-all-time/).

After the World Cup Baggio got ruled out for over three months after sustaining another knee injury.
Due to this, he only managed 17 Serie A appearances, but still contributed to his first Scudetto with Juventus by scoring 8 goals and 8 assists.
He also helped them win the Coppa Italia that year, notching 2 goals and 2 assists.
Baggio scored 115 goals in 200 appearances during his five seasons at Juventus.
In 1995, manager Marcello Lippi announced that Baggio no longer featured in their plans and decided to focus on emerging star Del Piero.

&amp;#x200B;

**[When Baggio was considered in decline](https://i.imgur.com/a3v20uv.gifv)**

Baggio was sold to A.C. Milan amidst several protests from Juventus fans.
Although Baggio initially struggled with injuries at the beginning of his first season with rossoneri, he came back into the starting line-up and helped Milan win the Serie A title.
Baggio finished the season with only 7 goals in 28 appearances, but provided 12 assists making him the top assist provider that year.
The following season after a series of disappointing results, Baggio was relegated to the bench and Milan's former coach Arrigo Sacchi was called back in to replace Tabarez.
Sacchi gave Baggio limited playing time, and he soon fell out of form.
In 1997, Capello returned to A.C. Milan, subsequently stating Baggio was not a part of his plans with the club.
Baggio wanted to move to Parma, but the manager Carlo Ancelotti impeded the transfer as he did not feel Baggio would fit into his tactical plans.
After Ancelotti's shocking refusal, Baggio decided to move to Bologna to help save them from relegation.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Who needs tactical plans when you have Baggio?](https://i.imgur.com/sifSX1v.gifv)**  

Not only he maintaned his promise, he also managed to score 22 goals in the process ranking third in the capocannoniere list.
Baggio refound his form with the club and had a dominant season, also providing 9 assists.
His performances earned him a place in Italy's 1998 World Cup selection.
In the opening match against Chile, Baggio played all 90 minutes as Del Piero was still recovering from an injury.
Vieri opened the scoring from a Baggio assist, but Chile managed to equalise and eventually take the lead.
Baggio created several chances, but Italy were unable to equalise. Towards the end of the match, Baggio obtained a fortunate penalty for Italy.
He stepped up to take it and scored Italy's equalising goal, becoming the first Italian player to score in 3 World Cups.
This was the first penalty he had taken for Italy since the final in 1994.  

&amp;#x200B;

**[""Penalties are only missed by those who take them""](https://i.imgur.com/L8fZa1M.gifv)**  
 
Baggio scored his second goal of the tournament in Italy's final group match against Austria, which ended in a 2–1 for Italy.
He came on during the second half, replacing Del Piero, after the crowd had begun to chant his name.
With this goal, he tied Paolo Rossi's record for most goals by an Italian player in the WC finals, with 9.
He was left on the bench for the round of 16 win over Norway as Italy advanced to the quarter-finals against France.
Baggio came on as a substitute for Del Piero in the second half, and managed to create some scoring opportunities.
The match against France eventually went to a penalty shootout, although Baggio converted his own the match was won by the host nation.

After the 1998 World Cup, Baggio signed with Ronaldo's Inter in order to compete in the Champions League.
Injuries, disappointing results and several managerial changes made Baggio struggle to gain playing time.
Often used out of position as a winger, or as a substitute, Baggio only scored 5 goals but provided 10 assists in 23 appearances during 98-99 season.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Scoring four goals in CL, including a memorable brace against Real Madrid](https://i.imgur.com/an1b1il.gifv)**  

He helped Inter through the qualifying rounds to the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by Manchester United.
Then Baggio's former manager at Juventus Marcello Lippi was appointed as Inter's new coach.
Lippi did not favour Baggio and left him out of the squad for most of the season, stating he was ""out of shape"".
This is considered by many (maybe just me) one of the worst crimes in football history.
After a disappointing season, Inter's chief Moratti had stated Lippi would only stay on if the team qualified for the CL.
When the playoff match against Parma for the last remaining CL spot took place, Lippi was forced to field Baggio due to several players being injured.
In his final match for nerazzurri, his last contribution was making them qualify for the CL.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Scoring twice against a defensive side made of Buffon, Thuram and Fabio Cannavaro](https://i.imgur.com/7TcX4kc.gifv)**

That night he was given a perfect 10 rating from La Gazzetta.
Baggio later decided not to renew his expiring contract due to his conflicts with Lippi, who remained Inter coach mainly thanks to his efforts.
At 33 years of age he made himself a free agent, everyone thought it was the end but Baggio wasn't done yet.
Coach Carlo Mazzone incredibly managed to bring him to Serie A newcomers Brescia, and that's the final and most romantic act of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

**[All Baggio wanted at that point was to save Brescia from relegation](https://i.imgur.com/bWsqbzb.gifv)**

In the second half of the season Andrea Pirlo was loaned to Brescia, where he played alongside his childhood idol.
As Baggio occupied the attacking midfield role, Carlo Mazzone became the first coach to deploy Pirlo as a deep-lying playmaker.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Good fucking call Carletto](https://i.imgur.com/tN0Jc3o.gifv)**  

During the four years with Baggio, Brescia recorded their best ever Serie A run and were never relegated as result.
Despite his performances and public demand, Italy's coach Trapattoni did not deem him fully fit, and left him out of the 2002 WC.
Trapattoni also expressed concern due to the presence of Totti and Del Piero, believing that this could create a rivalry between them.
After missing out on the tournament, Baggio reversed his initial decision to retire after the WC, expressing his intention to surpass 200 goals in Serie A.
He retired two years later as Brescia's all-time leading goalscorer and ended his career with 205 goals in the league.

&amp;#x200B;

**[Mazzone completely losing his shit after a last minute equalizer by Roberto](https://i.imgur.com/zO5xpcf.gifv)**      

""*You can always manage to put failures aside, but you will never truly erase them*"" Baggio said in a recent interview. Maybe that's true, we can't erase those awful moments. Especially the injuries and relapses, and of course the infamous penalty against Brazil. But maybe we can prevent them from overshadowing such a brilliant, unique and often understated career.

440,What manager-club matchups are you surprised haven't happened yet?,"This is just something I daydreamed about yesterday. I remember about a year and a half ago Big Sam was linked with West Brom and thinking it sounded right. He was later linked with Villa and that seemed to sound right as well. It just seemed like the kind of club he'd manage - he has a history of managing of historic clubs like Preston, Notts County Bolton, Newcastle, Blackburn, Sunderland (all of whom are either founder members of the Football League or early members). Wasn't alone in thinking that - one football journalist said he had to double check on Wikipedia because it just felt like something that happened before (Mandela effect in action there).

So it got me thinking, what are some other managers are you surprised haven't managed a certain club yet.

 [https://www.sporty.co.nz/asset/downloadasset?id=f96858d5-b702-44e5-bd9a-427d2386be51](https://www.sporty.co.nz/asset/downloadasset?id=f96858d5-b702-44e5-bd9a-427d2386be51) 

New Zealand is going to play only one match throughout this year. It's going to be away friendly versus Ireland. 

I understand that they are going to play in OFC Cup in 2020 (no qualifications for NZ needed) in the similar time as EURO 2020 and those matches will be the first competitive matches after intercontinental play-off against Peru, IIRC.

Could anyone tell why NZMNT couldn't arange more friendlies, given that OFC didn't make qualifications for OFC Cup for more than 4 teams?",soccer,1562156736,AgreeableSearch1,2,2,True,2019-07-03
474,Question about Dybala and where he would play for Argentina,"So every time I watch Argentina play, I'll always see people saying ""Why isn't Dybala playing?"", and while I do think Dybala is a good player, I don't really know where he would fit in our team.

[Here was our lineup for the match against Brazil](https://imgur.com/a/g9BKvFV)

To my understanding, Dybala pretty much plays where Messi is playing right now, and I don't see him taking that position until Messi decides to hang it up.

I suppose he could also play in one of the two positions up top, but Lautaro is already pretty good, and Aguero (when he shows up) is a lethal finisher.

So the question still remains, where does Dybala fit into all this?",soccer,1562158115,Erquiaga,17,2,True,2019-07-03

485,Please help my 8 year old son,"Hi all,

Our son loves footy and as you can see from this video he's not the best but he does try. He is very shy and keeps practicing but he really wants to play for a team but unfortunately he struggles with his confidence. 

I hope that he could get some good feedback on this video he made for fun I find it quite funny perhaps I''m biased as his father. 

Any positive feedback would give him some confidence to actually get out of the garden and go and play for a team I have took him but he starts crying and says he is not good enough :(

22,Set piece advice,"So the other day I saw this free kick routine by Torino against AC Milan ([https://streamable.com/vkzgj](https://streamable.com/vkzgj)) on this very subreddit, and I gave it a try with my team (I currently coach the Music Department team in my university) to great results, as it turned out to be a goal (it hit the post and we lated scored the rebound).

&amp;#x200B;

This week we finished the league stage (6th out of 12) and have qualified for the quarterfinals, but we are big underdogs in our next match (vs Physical Education, so you'll guess it's a tough draw for us) and we are looking for other clever free kick or corner routines as a way to surprise them and grab an unexpected win.  


So, r/soccer, can you recommend me some free kick routines to try in training this week for the big match? If you need some extra info: Our two starting Central Midfielders are great at long shots, but we are not great at headers.",soccer,1561229026,nibeconcha,12,6,True,2019-06-22

145,Opinion: USWNT is a much better watch than the USMNT,I have a theory about why the US women’s team has much more success than the men’s. To me it’s simple; our best women athletes play soccer. Soccer (or Football) is the 5th most popular sport in the US. Yet IMO more girls play soccer early on and stick with it than men. Therefore our best men athletes play football basketball baseball hockey before soccer. Imagine trying to stop Westbrook getting on the end of a through ball lmao. I just wanted to get you guys’ opinion on this cause at least for me I thoroughly enjoy watching the USWNT way kore than the men.,soccer,1561247841,cloutboyray,25,0,True,2019-06-22

[](#bar-1-txt-white)[**Pre-Mourinho (Intro)**](#bar-13-txtwhite-blue)[](#bar-1-txt-white)

When beginning to look at Portguese football, it would be somewhat fitting to go abroad first. After all Portugal has often found its success by starting overseas. In football this begins in Hungary, where Portugal found beautiful football being played. It did not take long for Portugal to take influence from Hungary, leading to Benfica gaining its greatest achievement under the great Hungarian manager, Bela Guttmann, who won them their first two pieces of European silverware in 1960 and 1961. Guttman makes up just one of seven Hungarian coaches who have plied their trade at Benfica (most doing so early in the clubs history). This trend can be seen with all three of the big portguese clubs: Porto have had 9 different Hungarian coaches and Sporting having had just 4. Most of these signings came in during the middle of the 20th century when Hungary was streets ahead of many other national by plying a new approach to attacking football (but also for their ability to produce some of the best attacking talent on the planet). Portuguese clubs were then able to see the same benefits of this, with Guttmann kick starting the career of the young Eusebio.

As the years went by, we began to associate Portugal with this attacking football and with those technically gifted footballers. So when Porto were in need of a new coach in 1994 and saw the opportunity to bring in Bobby Robson in 1994 (an attacking minded English coach with international experience), they could not refuse the offer. After all, Robson was an attacking foreign coach who proved he could apply a decisive play style in multiple countries and had done well at Sporting Lisbon (meaning Porto also got to steal a manager from one other members of the big three). However, Robson was not a great speaker of Portuguese so he had to bring along his translator, a young Jose Mourinho. At the time, it was a mere side note on most news articles but for Porto, this was their first interaction with the man who would change Porto’s history and Portugese football history as a whole.

---

[](#bar-1-txt-blue)[**Mourinho’s Innovation**](#bar-10-txtblue-white)[](#bar-1-txt-blue)

&gt;**Section 1**

&gt; After Robson’s success at Porto, Mourinho followed Robson to Barca in 1996 where Jose became known, demeaningly, as ‘the translator’ despite the fact he was very involved in how the players were coached defensively (which was the case at Porto as well). Mourinho remained during Van Gaal’s tenure at the club after Robson moved away from Barcelona. This is where Jose became recognised as more of a coach, as he no longer just planned training but was the one walking the players through the training. It was with that experience that Mourinho felt himself ready to move to another club, Van Gaal insisting that he only take a managerial role instead of accepting one of the coaching offers he had received. Mourinho moved to Benfica as head coach in 2000 and had a fairly miserable time, it was his following stint at Uniao de Leiria where his talent as a manager emerged. He challenged Portugal’s hegemonic structure by making Uniao de Leiria look like a possible big three contender (tbf the league was in a transitional moment with Porto and Benfica looking slightly weaker at this time). With that, Mourinho had proved the Benfica doubters wrong and found himself employed at Porto (2002) where he would continue Porto’s domestic success which Robson and Fernando Santos had found in their time at the club. Yet domestic success at Porto is not the crown jewel it would be considered in England or Italy. After all, Porto were one of the big three who were expected to be in that position. What blew the minds of the Portuguese was the European success which Mourinho attained with the squad. Winning the Uefa cup in 2002-03 and then doing the unimaginable, winning the champions league the year after.

While we now praise Mourinho’s Premier League success, his Inter treble and toppling the unbeatable Barca, his truly most unlikely success was with Porto. At this time his approach was experimental and new but that experiment was not happening on the pitch but on the training ground. Mourinho was applying academic thinking to how his team was trained, like Lobanovskyi did in Ukraine years before. Mourinho’s mentors in this aspect were Portuguese sports scientists, Manuel Sergio and Vitor Frade. Vitor Frade was the innovator of tactical periodisation, which is a method that Mourinho took to heart. The idea which Frade departed on Mourinho was taking a single training session and devising exercises which would teach the team the coaches tactical vision, mold the team to be physically ready for that vision and also be technically capable of playing that football. This was not just a time saving methods but it allowed for the manager to create an environment where the players were holistically coached to think, exercise and train in the methods of the coach. For example, if I wanted my attackers to compete for the second ball and have my defenders learn to cope with long ball, I might use this [training session](https://imgur.com/awJLuGN). While now there are hundreds of methods available online for any coach to pick from (https://tacticalpedia.com/playbook/), Mourinho and his staff would have to develop whole new training exercises which would indoctrinate the players into a Mourinho-esque style of play.

Manuel Sergio (Mourinho’s other mentor) appeared as more of a philosopher then Vitor Frade, who would go into coaching himself. Manuel Sergio pushed Mourinho into looking at how to properly train his team so that they would remain fresh for every match, with the strongest players available for the next game. Tactical periodisation also allowed for this by splitting the week into various working days and rest days which would allow the players to have days where they prepared to play against their opponents and then have other days where they developed their own playstyle. Sergio also stressed the mental aspect of sports, making it clear that Mourinho would need to have a strong group of players who would fight like they were not playing a game but waging war, with Mourinho being their fearless leader.

&gt; **Section 2**

&gt; While Mourinho’s new training methods presented a new fashion of coaching in to the mainstream, there have been examples of those who have introduced some similar ideas throughout the years. Even in Portugal, Jimmy Hagan took Benfica to an unbeaten season and a Champions League semifinal in the 70s using a similar idea to tactical periodisation by combining tactical, physical and technical elements into each training exercise (most likely a somewhat simpler method than what the concept is today). However, the Englishman did not implement a similar focus on fitness like modern tactical periodisation would do. Hagan would coach Fernando Santos at G.D. Estoril in the 80s, with Santos taking inspiration from the English ex-pat. In Ukraine, Lobanovskyi was far more focused on the long term fitness of his squad throughout the season and would also value the psychological element of the game. His training methods created teams who were versatile in their setup but played with a Lobanistic mindset.

Adding to this, Mourinho had gained an impressive, if not unmatched level of tactical analysis through his coaching career. During his time with Robson and Van Gaal, Mourinho would create match reports on opposition teams who Robson would have to face. Some can be found [online](https://imgur.com/bVQmWS3), but each shows the drastic level of [detail](https://imgur.com/eBAQcK6) which was presented in those reports with no opposition [movement](https://imgur.com/ShXGV0H) or [play](https://imgur.com/ROHEu2P) not being noted by Mourinho or one of his staff members. This level of tactical knowledge and Mourinho’s particular coaching methods allowed for him to be a very versatile manager at the time, implementing varying tactical systems within the space of a week or two. This was only boosted by the players being completely committed to the Mourinho ideals.

&gt; **Section 3**

&gt; Mourinho seemed to take this level of analysis from the Italian game, as much of his view of defending and how to cope with talented opposition mirrored the basic ideas of catenaccio and the libero (could be a similar logical path followed). Mourinho would often play with a form of man marking when dealing with the most gifted players on the planet. However, instead of using a free-man in defence to sweep up trouble, he would have the ‘libero’ man mark the most dangerous player on the pitch to make it harder for them to receive the ball. If the target did receive the ball, then the libero would receive support, doubling up on the man marked player. There are obvious examples of this, like Hazard often being man marked by Herrera in the Man United-Chelsea games last season. There have been times when Mourinho has used a more zonal system to combat those players, like when his Inter played Barca in the champions league and Messi would be handled by the appropriately zoned player as he moved from zone to zone, trying to drag opponents with him.

It only took Mourinho a season to create one of the most athletic, tacticall cohesive, well bonded and mentally strong teams in Europe. This would be impressive even if it was bankrolled to the extreme degree which teams now experienced but Mourinho’s Porto was built with players from smaller teams, mostly within Portugal. While football in 2003 was not on financial steroids like it is now, Porto’s team was still considered extremely cheaply recruited. Those players then had the specifics of how the team played change from week to week but they always played like Mourinho wanted his team to play.

Generally, Mourinho’s Porto played in a [4312](https://imgur.com/B0AzLSt) with width being provided by fullbacks and the three central midfielders dropping deeper in the midfield while the flanking midfielders carried the ball forward after winning it. Mourinho’s team was built on defensive stability but produced attractive counter attacking football at times with his team performing a press in their own half and moving the ball quickly to the attackers through the flanking midfielder and supported by the full backs. While the counter attacking methods were prevalent in their Champions League run, in the league the team could hold possession when playing the smaller sides but still preferred to be direct.The team played a slightly high line (known as a medium block) and kept a compact shape with the midfield and defensive line remaining close to prevent space appearing centrally, so the press would not present holes for the opposition to take advantage of.  It was not revolutionary, Lippi at Juventus had used something similar in the 90s and even before that, the general midfield style had been used by Argentina (with a more attacking focus). It was the work Mourinho did off the pitch which amazed, he improved mediocre players to be champions league quality and drilled his team better than anyone else in Europe. At Chelsea, he would further experiment with formation and team shape.

[](#bar-1-txt-white)[**The Post-Mourinho Porto**](#bar-13-txtwhite-blue)[](#bar-1-txt-white)

Mourinho had set a standard in Portugal, with a new found European success. He had introduced a whole new approach to coaching and seemed to combine a new set of characteristics for a manager. He was charismatic, tactically ingenious, a good coach and a motivator of his players. It is unsurprising that he became so desirable to clubs across Europe, with him taking his style to so many different football cultures and finding success. With that, a precedent was not just set within Portugal for local coaches but now the world had a standard which they would judge portuguese managers against. These managers had to cope with being the post-Mourinho generation of students, even if they did not draw direct influence from him, they would be thought of as being of the same ilk. Luckily for Portugal a scene was growing with more managers picking up the ways of tactical periodisation but also applying a similar level of academic appreciation to the beautiful game. This is the generation of portuguese managers who would develop in their homeland and then spread across Europe. 

Many of these managers are directly linked to Porto, with many have direct connections to Mourinho. In those years, Porto would not find the exact same level of success but would stumble across a group of portuguese managers who would grow at the club but sadly leave prematurely (in my opinion). All of them have some level of Mourinho in them but each has established their identity as well:

**Andres Villas Boas (2010-11)**

Andres Villas Boas’s greatest success has come at Porto, where he looked every bit the Mourinho successor. He was built for the role, he was mentored by Robson, assistant coached with Mourinho, wrote up scouting reports on opposition teams, proved himself at a smaller portuguese club and never had an impressive playing career. However, this did not mean that AVB was a Mourinho replica. He took more from Robson in footballing philosophy, with his love of attacking coming before reliance on solid defending. Despite this deviation, he still managed to win four trophies in a year with Porto, with one being a Europa League.

His [433](https://imgur.com/6yWvz8w) (moved on to a 4231) had direct attacking football and clearly took from Mourinho’s Chelsea team, which AVB coached. Even though 433 was focused on moving forward quickly, the team was just as comfortable holding possession. His wingers would tuck in to help the attack while the midfield had to be hard working to prevent central passes and remaining direct in attack. This approach also kept the 3 central midfielders protecting the backline and looking to compress the space in between the two lines if a pass was made by the opposition.

After his time at Porto, his football ideals appeared to deteriorate, with his times at Spurs and Chelsea presenting either stale possession play or aimless defending. His start at Chelsea was full of possession football but he began to resort to defensive football but lacked identity. This could be seen as the start of a wayward period for AVB. Say what you will about Mourinho, he never appeared wayward, maybe stubborn but not wayward. His spell at Zenit Saint Petersburg appeared to suggest a resurgence and he now residents in Marseille where he will look to continue proving himself on a big stage. 

AVB was also a tactical periodisation proponent but did so with less focus on the mental element and never gained the cult of personality which Mourinho achieved at his clubs. This lack of connection with the players exposes something which tactical periodisation hinges on; complete commitment from the players to the coaches ideas and investing in the coach himself. This is an aspect which AVB was not able to muster in his Premier league days. Another aspect which AVB lost when leaving Porto was the brilliant scouting system which the club had developed. Porto were making brilliant purchases from less developed markets (usually South American) and re-selling for double or triple what they originally paid. While this tactic had been in use in Russia with Spartak Moscow in the post-soviet countries, Porto had looked even farther afield and found greater talent to import.

**Paulo Fonseca (2013-14)**

Fonseca poses the most avant garde of the post-Mourinho managers. His time at Porto in the 90s briefly overlapped with Robson’s tenure at the club but he was never a player or coach under Mourinho. So fittingly, Fonseca’s successes have not come at Porto. It was his time at Braga after a poor season at Porto where he gained acclaim and then his time at Shakhtar donetsk helped shape people's opinion on him. While at Porto, he played a [433](https://imgur.com/c2JPHvK) which resembled the same approach as Mourinho’s Chelsea but did have different aspects. His defensive line played high up the pitch with a focus on aggressive centre backs pressing opponents receiving the ball while the three midfielders prevented easy access to the middle of the pitch. This was done by moving the two central midfielders higher up the pitch while the wingers remained slightly deeper, making the team look like an arrow, with the striker being flanked by the CMs who would block off the central passing lanes when the opposition full backs received the ball. Behind them is a destroyer who applies pressure, cuts passing lanes and starting the attacks after winning the ball. Fonseca enjoys direct attacking play, attempting to see any free space taken advantage of but this was in a different method to Mourinho. Fonseca did not mind having a fluid shape when attacking, with wingers come into the half spaces, flanking central midfielders joining the attacking or dropping into defence, or even the fullbacks moving centrally to find overloads. While an interesting idea, it did leave them exposed when losing the ball with their medium block needing to retreat when the opposition gained the ball back.

Fonseca’s later iterations of this idea would prove massively more successful. His time at Shaktar saw this idea take a more fully formed approach with more complex application of fluid passing maps mixed it with a medium block press. Much has been written on him, some links below will be helpful if you want to know more:
http://futbolgrad.com/paulo-fonseca-coach-shakhtar/
https://www.tifofootball.com/video/tactics-explained-shakhtar-donetsk/

I also summarised his style of play there in a previous write up: https://redd.it/b05100

Now he is manager of Roma and will look to take the next step to impress in European competition.

**Nuno Espirito Santos (2016-17)**

Nuno (in my personal opinion) is the closest we have to an actual Mourinho look-a-like in these Porto managers who came after the special one (but even then, he is very different from Jose). Nuno was never a great player, when he played at Porto with Mourinho as manager, he was the reserve keeper. Mourinho still took a liking to Santos and supposedly saw a manager in him, which Nuno corroborates saying that he learned a great deal from watching Mourinho in his Porto days. Yet, the similarities continue as Nuno’s philosophy follows what was laid out back in his Porto playing days. He values building a team from the back but is fully capable, if not expecting, his team to produce good attacking football. However to achieve good attacking football, the defensive work has to be completed first and that has to be done with a press. At Porto, this press looked fairly similar to Mourinho’s with a focus on blocking the central area when out of possession by positioning the midfield and defence in close lines but Nuno added his own idea to this at Porto and Wolves. While keeping the middle compact, the wide areas were left exposed on purpose with a single defender, so the opposition wide man would attempt to make progress in that position. This progress would spark a press which would then lead to a counter form the wide position if the ball was successfully won (something Fonseca would use at Shaktar). Nuno, again like Mourinho, was not wed to one system and remains fluid in his ideal structure on the pitch. At Porto, it appears he used [442](https://imgur.com/Vab78KU) in some champions league games while also using a 442 diamond in the league but changing to a 343 in the championship with wolves and has settled on a 532/352 in the premier league.

Nuno even has a charisma and charm mixed with an obvious work ethic that makes many view him as somewhat sympathetic and likeable. From interviews, his players seem to be very enamored with him as well, suggesting a good atmosphere for the use of tactical periodisation. Along with this, he avoids being stubborn in his methods of play, being perfectly fine with not being the dominant possession team, like when his Wolves side found success against Liverpool in the cup (Wolves generally enjoy underdog status a la Mourinho). This young manager only remained a year at Porto and moved on to Spain (Valencia) and now England but his influence could continue to grow if he finds further success with the Wolves team who are already looking at attempting to break European competition. Alternatively, he takes the Mourinho model and moves to another club to ply his trade with more proven group of players.

**Sergio Conceicao (2017-current manager)**

Porto’s current manager, Sergio Conceicao, comes from a uniquely different background than those who came before. He enjoyed a great and successful career while playing, then moved onto management where he gained a good reputation outside of Portugal before moving back home to take over the portuguese club. He presents a newer possible archetype of portuguese managers who can have both academic rigour involved in their management while still having enjoyed a good career.

Conceicao is one of the strong followers of Vitor Frade’s theories which is why he is probably the most structurally flexible of all the post-Mourinho Porto coaches. His team can change shape but the basic ideas of the manager remains pure. These ideas are not mourinho-esque however, as they involve a high-line, pressing intensely and favouring possession football. At Porto this usually takes the shape of a [442](https://imgur.com/BzZBKcf) or 433 which sees wingers move centrally while always using a destroyer in the centre midfield partnership who can closely monitor the backline’s safety. It's been this new, yet somewhat familiar approach which won Porto their first title since 2013 and then allowed them to reach the knockout stages of two champions leagues only to be put out by the runners up and then winners in the following year, Liverpool.

This set of managers clearly do not take sole inspiration from Mourinho, especially in a footballing world so interconnected that you can draw ideas from multiple parts of the planet (unlike 20 or 30 years ago). Yet, there are qualities which do seem to show up again and again, the first being tactical periodisation’s prevalence amongst this group. This may well be helped by the fact that Porto offers a safe environment to test out your style of Periodisation as the players are so used to it and will invest in the portuguese managers ideals more quickly than an English or Spainish group of players. Secondly, the medium block which can press seems very popular amongst this group and it does show the basic idea that these managers care about solid defending and building a team from the back (outside of AVB). Finally, the flexibility which these managers show with formations and systems. Like many other managers in Germany are now saying (like Nagelsmann), formations can be a constraining label which prevents a more fluid and flexible interpretation of the game. This set of manager still have a shadow of Mourinho over them in a less intense manner than would have been the case at Porto five years ago, but they still will want to emulate Jose and prove that he was not the only special one from Portugal.

[](#bar-1-txt-white)[**Benfica’s Response**](#bar-13-txtwhite-red)[](#bar-1-txt-white)

While all of the post-Mourinho managers had a great amount of potential, most did not get the chance to show their true potential in Portugal as they were overshadowed by the far more experience Jorge Jesus at Benfica. Jesus’s entry into Benfica (2009-15) signalled a down turn for Porto and growth for Benfica which continues today (although less obvious currently). 

Jesus brought a level of maturity (sometimes) and well travelled ideas which most of Porto’s younger managers were unable to provide. Jesus also arrived as Benfica’s focus on producing portuguese talent was beginning to pay dividends. Jesus took advantage of many great players being developed within the club, with the likes of Andre Gomes, Bernardo Silva and Joao Canelo being stand-outs. Along with that, they were able to simultaneously create an impressive scouting network which probably surpassed Porto’s, making better use of the eastern European markets and picking up good south americans at the same time. All of this gave Benfica a very profitable business model as Jesus was not just a good manager but a great developer of talent, along with his coaching staff. Even Jesus’s style provided a quality environment for technical development and physical improvement as Jesus’s Benfica played an attacking and dynamic brand of football. Primarily this took the shape of a [4312](https://imgur.com/9NQsfKr) at the start but developed in a 433 as time moved on. His 4312 gave the fullbacks license to progress up the pitch, the two strikers play as a traditional big man+second striker partnership and played with three attacking midfielders with two playing in a deeper part of the diamond, showing good versatility in their ability to build up play, show defensive solidity and attacking intent. Both those midfielders, usually, also had the ability of playing with greater width and pulling opposition midfielders out of position or creating wide overloads. Jesus could be viewed as a modern call back to the Portuguese style of old. It was attacking, but not a guardiola offshoot and it retained a local identity which embraced imported and homegrown players to reach their potential. Player like Aimar were understood and given the role which allowed them to flourish in attacking football. Nevertheless do not be fooled, Jesus was a canny tactician who revelled in surprising opponents and often gloated when he found their weakness.

However this style had its limited, it achieved great domestic success but continued to fall short of the european success which Porto had enjoyed. Benfica was not a flexible side and like playing in a certain way. That way involved playing with an imbalanced midfield and continuous need to attack, making European success difficult against certain teams. While Benfica fans pointed to the table, Porto fans still had fresh memories of a Europa League victory and a slightly faded champions league win to retreat to. With that Jesus left, meaning that Benfica would replace him with a manager who they thought could take that next step, Rui Victoria. Victoria was closer to the Mourinho style of management, with a focus on academic football having never been a successful player himself. While having success initially, winning two titles in a row, he soon was replaced Carlos Carvahal’s assistant manager, Bruno Lage. In half a season, Lage put Benfica back on track to keep their domestic dominance, winning the title playing attractive attacking football while having been behind the league leaders by 9 points when joining the club.

&gt; **Section 4**

&gt; During all of this, Braga had an impressive managerial output: Jorge Jesus, Leonardo Jardim, Sergio Conceição and Paulo Fonseca have had stints at the club and their current manager, Abel Ferreira, is showing his potential with impressive finishes in the league and a cup win. Jardim’s success after leaving Portugal has proved particularly astounding as he has taken Monaco to a league title and Champions League quarter finals while changing the focus of the team from attacking to defensive football within the space of a season. Sporting has had the opposite luck managerially while having stunning players come through the club, the only managers who are majorly recognisable are Marco Silva and Jorge Jesus.

[](#icon-star) **Conclusion**

Portuguese managers have become a norm in most leagues around Europe and there is a general level of respect concerning those managers. That respect is generally well earned, as we currently have Mourinho being an elder statesman of the game despite only being in his 50s, Portugal as European Champions and Nations League Champions due to the canny operations of Fernando Santos and a set of Portuguese managers who survive in different footballing cultures with relative ease. I feel this could even be comparable to the Austrian coffeehouses of Vienna during footballs early days. In those coffeehouses, fans and enthusiasts of the still maturing game would critically discuss how best to play. From that many great managers emerged and spread their knowledge across europe. Portugal now has developed an academic thought process to the modern game and is able to spread that approach across Europe.

This write-up has tried to not focus on those managers ideas when they left portugal but see how they incubated those ideas while still in the country of their origin. In their own culture they were able to produce something interesting and full of potential which could then be taken out to Europe. In a world where football becomes more interconnected, it is interesting to see that Portugal was still able to make something niche. Portugal had seen a lot of foreign influence when it came to football but over the past two decades, Portuguese football has gained confidence in its own impressive ability. This niche had to be introduced by someone and of course it was Mourinho. As I have done multiple write-ups focusing on multiple countries, my respect for what Mourinho was during the 2000s and early 2010s has only grown as he remains a pivotal and special manager.",soccer,1561289940,TheRetiredPlaymaker,58,773,True,2019-06-23

#Aaron Martin 
**Player Info**



Name | Aaron Martin 
---|---
**Age** | 22
**Position** | LB
**Foot** | Left
**Current Team** |Mainz 05
**Shirt Number** | 3
**Nationality** | Spanish
**Height** | 5'9

- **17/18**, Following season he carried on being the first choice LB under Enrique Sanchez Flores starting 32 league games and again registering 0 assists. However, he developed in the more creative sense  he went from 0.7 key passes to 1.1 key passes. He also had expected assist numbers 2.46.  

- Following Season New Manager Rubi decided to loan him out to Mainz with an option to buy for 6m, which Mainz have already implemented. 

**18/19 Stats for Mainz :**



Minutes | 2879
---|----
**Goals** | 0
**Assists** | 3
**Crosses** | 3.3
**Key Passes** | 1.7
**Dribbles Completed** | 1.4
**Tackles** | 1.7
**Interceptions** | 1.2



**Strengths and Weakness:**

 - **Strengths**:
- As I mentioned in the play style he is very attacking, Constant overlapping runs. Pacey, can get up and down the pitch pretty quickly.

- Crossing, One of the things he improved most in Mainz under Sandro Schwarz is his crossing, he's crossing numbers went up from 0.5 to 1.6. Significant improvements. 

- He can find a long pass, specially in behind the defense to a pacey striker.

 - **Weakness** 
- In the air, he can be caught out as he isn't the tallest. Which can be a bit of a problem at times for most teams. 

- Also one of the things I've noticed while watching him is that he holds on to the ball for too long, sometimes he can be caught out but its one of those little things can be improved over the years. 

**Future Plans**

- In my opinion he can stay at Mainz for another season, If he wants to stay in Bundesliga then maybe one of the teams in top 6/7 will be perfect for him. Likes of Rose, Naggelsman, Bosz they all like high attacking Left Backs. 

- Elsewhere, he could wait another year and sign for Chelsea as a replacement for Marcos Alonso, 

- Roma as a Replacement for Kolarov and also he will fit in perfectly in Fonseca's system.",soccer,1561301104,LubenRoftusCheek,8,80,True,2019-06-23

365,The controversial story of Paulino Alcantara: the Filipino-Catalonian who played for Barcelona and fought for Francisco Franco.,"Paulino Alcántara was born in 1896 in Concepcion, Philippines to a Spanish military officer and an Ilongga mother. 

He was three years old when his family moved to Barcelona, the same year that FC Barcelona was formed by Joan Gamper. Alcántara was slated to play for FC Galeno when he was discovered by Gamper. He then joined Barcelona's youth team. He made his debut at the age of 15 years, on 25 February 1912 against Catalá SC in the Campionat de Catalunya. Barcelona won that game 9–0, with Alcántara scoring the first three goals of the game, setting the still unbroken record for being the youngest player to ever score for FC Barcelona in an official match. He went on to help the club win a Copa del Rey and Campionat de Catalunya in 1913 and 1916.

In 1916, Alcántara's parents returned to the Philippines and took their son with them. There he continued his studies in medicine and played football for the Bohemian Sporting Club. He helped the club win two Philippine Championships, in 1917 and 1918.

After returning to Barcelona in 1919, he helped the club win another Campionat de Catalunya. The club also reached the Copa del Rey final but lost 5–2 to Arenas Club de Getxo. On 13 April 1919 in a game at Les Corts against Real Sociedad, Alcántara scored the ""police goal,"" when a policeman got in the way of a powerful shot, so both the ball and policeman ended up in the back of the net. In 1920 the club won another Copa del Rey and the Campionat de Catalunya. This marked the beginning of the club's first golden era and saw them dominate both the Campionat de Catalunya and Copa del Rey tournament. Alcántara scored twice in the 1922 Cup final, where Barcelona defeated Real Unión 5–1 and scored the winning goal in the 3–2 win over Atlético Madrid in the 1926 final.

In 1915, Alcántara made his debut with Catalunya team and in 1924 he played at least six games and scored at least four goals for the team. In 1917 he was selected by the Philippines national team and represented the country at the Far Eastern Championship Games in Tokyo, helping them defeat Japan 15-2.
In 1920 Alcántara was selected to represent Spain at the 1920 Olympics. However, Alcántara chose to stay at home to take his final medical exams. He eventually made his debut for Spain on 7 October 1921 at the age of 25 against Belgium and scored both goals in a 2–0 win. In 1922, he was nicknamed ""El Rompe Redes"" or ""Trencaxarxes"" (the net breaker) after he broke the net with a shot during a match against France. He made five appearances and scored six goals for Spain between 1921 and 1927.

Alcántara retired on 3 July 1927 in order to become a doctor at age 31. He later served as a club director between 1931 and 1934. 

In the 1930s, Paulino Alcántara was a member of the Falange Española, the variant of Spanish Fascism. On 4 August 1936, he fled to Andorra and France for failing to Franco's coup in Barcelona from 18 July 1936. In 1936 Alcantara was Carlist volunteer and participated in numerous military operations of the nationalist troops of Francisco Franco. During the Spanish Civil War, Alcántara was Lieutenant of the first battalion of the Brigade Legionary Black Arrows (Frecce Nere), a volunteer corps directed directly by Benito Mussolini. With the Black Arrows, Alcantara served on the fronts of Guadalajara, Aragon and Catalonia. He entered victorious by Barcelona with General Yägue on 26 January 1939. Yagüe became known as the ""Butcher of Badajoz"" because he ordered thousands killed, including wounded men in the hospital. 

After the Spanish Civil War, Paulino Alcántara lived in Barcelona and was Lieutenant of the Black Arrows. During the Spanish State, Alcántara was a Chief of the Falange Española. He died in Barcelona in 1964, aged 67.

370,ELI a dumb American: how do players change teams in European football?,"In the US major sports, player placement generally works like this:

1. Player gets drafted by a team out of high school/college/juniors/whatever depending on the sport. They have no say in where they go, and their salary is generally either fixed based on draft position or heavily regulated.
2. The team that drafts them hold exclusive rights to the player for a certain amount of time. Eventually (and this varies by sport), their ""rookie contract"" will expire and they will become a free agent.
3. In free agency, players are free to negotiate and sign with any team for any amount of money, within the bounds of the salary cap and collective bargaining agreement of that league. This is the first time players really have any say in their destination.
4. Teams can also release their rights to a player, making them instantly a free agent, or can trade the player to another team, in exchange for another player, draft picks, and/or cash (sometimes).

I'm trying to figure it how it works in Europe. First, there doesn't seem to be a draft, which makes sense because there's so many different leagues all across Europe. How do players get to their initial teams?

Second, I don't think I've ever heard of a ""trade"" in European football, just ""transfers"". From what I can gather, it sounds like transfers are always just trades for cash. Is that right?

Finally, I don't think I've ever heard anything about free agency in Europe. Do players never get to choose where to go (aside from their current team being nice and asking their opinion about a transfer)?

""Secondly, I came to this World Cup to be successful and to play a part in making women's football globally more visible. We wanted to put on a show. I sat through 90 minutes of football there and felt ashamed. I was proud of performances, under circumstances I’ve never seen before. And I am completely and utterly ashamed of the opposition. I didn’t enjoy the game. My players didn’t enjoy the game, apart from getting to the quarter-finals.

""All the young boys and girls watching...and we’ve had five, six and seven million people watching back at home against Cameroon with that kind of behavior. That’s pretty sad. I’ve got to tell the truth to everyone. I’m so proud of their behaviour. It takes you back to times when you went home crying with your ball.""",soccer,1561315407,ForensicShoe,0,0,True,2019-06-23

1': We're off!

3': SAVE! Senegal steals the ball in the back, Niang fires but Manula saves! Sarr gets the rebound but slices it high.

5': Senegal hits the side netting!

9': [](#icon-yellow) *Feisal Salum* with a real awful challenge to take down Sarr and then steps on his arm

13': Sabaly fires low from outside the edge of the box, but it's easily saved by Manula.

14': [](#icon-yellow) *Badou Ndiaye* takes down Msuva who's breaking forward on the counter

19': Yahya with the shot! Goes over the bar, but a good demonstration from Tanzania that they are not intimidated.

21': Oh no, Salif Sané has landed badly and it looks very bad. The stretcher is out.

22': Sané is being looked at on the touchline, and now Niang has been taken down with a real rough studs-up challenge by Mwantika and now he looks hurt.

23': Koulibaly gets a header on the corner kick but puts it over. Senegal playing with nine at the moment.

24': [](#icon-sub) Senegal substitution: *Cheikhou Kouyaté* on for *Salif Sané*. Niang has returned to the field also.

33': SAVE! Manula stops a shot but bobbles the rebound, the Senegalese bundle it into the back of the net but they're whistled for a foul or maybe handball. Lucky for the Tanzanians.

35': [](#icon-yellow) *Himid Mao Mkami* into the book for something, I don't know, too much is going on and it's getting ugly

42': Senegal gets a free kick on the right side of the box, Ndiaye tries to hit a scissor kick but puts it high.

**HT Senegal 1-0 Tanzania** Baldé has given his team the expected lead in a very ugly game.

46': We're back!

46': SAVE!! Manula gets up high to deny a bullet header that's dipping just under the bar!

50': Niang's header prompts a diving attempt at a save from the keeper but was always going wide.

#[](#sprite6-p41) Introduction


 Widely seen as one of if not the **best CONCACAF national team after the US and Mexico**, Costa Rica have relatively underachieved in recent times other than their terrific run in the 2014 World Cup. They’ve been to 5 world cups and have exited at the group stage in 3 of them and despite their quality in comparison to the rest of CONCACAF nations they have reached the semi finals of the gold cup only twice since they last won the competition in 1989.

They are however punching above their weight in a lot of ways as a nation of around 5 million people. They have a **good core of talented players and will be looking to go on a deep run and to challenge Mexico/USA for the trophy with some luck.**

#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch

[](#icon-star-big) [**Kendall Waston (CB)**](https://www.tsn.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1124926!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/kendall-waston.jpg)

 The **6’5(195 cm) defender** may be familiar to MLS fans playing with the Whitecaps and now Cincinnati, he looks set to anchor the defensive unit for Costa Rica. He’s picked **up his scoring rate internationally** in the past several years [(including a goal vs Switzerland in the WC)](https://streamable.com/z6y2d) and should be a threat on set pieces as well, with **7 goals in 29 matches** from CB already with *Los Ticos*



[](#icon-star-big) [**Joel Campbell (ST)**](http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Joel+Campbell+Switzerland+Vs+Costa+Rica+Group+k4VuV8GDo8Gl.jpg) 

 The former Arsenal man will be one of Costa Rica’s key players in attack. He will most likely be deployed as one of the 2 forwards, but with somewhat of a loose role. His club form has been relatively mediocre with 4 goals and 1 assist in 19 games and Costa Rica will need better than that from him to make a deep run.

 Under Óscar Ramírez, Campbell was used primarily as an impact sub because he'd typically get gassed pretty quickly


[](#icon-star-big) [**Randall Leal (MF)**](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1107719355385696257/6td_wA1z_400x400.jpg)

 Gonna be honest, couldn't find too much on him, but he plays as an attacking for Costa Rica's best domestic team in Saprissa and at only 22 years old has 8 caps to his name and should be starting for Costa Rica in a squad full of veterans.




---

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- #### **Where do the goals come from?**
 
 Costa Rica have not been a high scoring team in recent times as mentioned. They’ve **scored more than 1 goal only 2 times in their previous 12 competitive game**s, stretching back to World Cup qualifying, **and have gone goalless in 6 of those**. Bryan Ruiz(25 in 120 apps) and Celso Borges(21 in 120 apps) are their current leading scorers with Joel Campbell the most likely to be their attacking outlet(17 in 85 apps)

- #### **Is this their time to finally win it?**

 Their squad is good enough for a deep run and with then they just need good performances and some luck to get past the US and/or Mexico. A win would obviously be a fantastic achievement but they will definitely need their senior players to step up and lead the way

 With the USA and Mexico in a transition phase under new managers and them phasing in relatively new players etc., and with Mexico missing a fair few of their key players, Costa Rica will fancy their chances of reaching the final. If things go according to plan, They are on a collision course to meet Mexico in the semifinals.

- #### **No more 5-4-1/3-4-3!**

 One of the staples of Costa Rican football for the past several years before Matosas came in was their tried and tested 5-4-1 formation. **Even through several different managers, the same shape remained.** The formation worked well for *Los Ticos* because of their typically great depth at CB (*Acosta, Waston, Gonzalez, Duarte, Calvo, etc.*) and fullbacks/wingbacks who are quick and above average when going forward (*Gamboa, Matarrita, Oviedo*). It provides defensive stability against the big teams (as seen against Brazil in the 2018 WC where they held them scoreless until injury time, the 2014 WC run, etc.) though when in possession the wide men push more forward to create a fluid attacking style.

 Matostas has steered away from that, going with a 4-4-2, with mixed results so far, it will be interesting to see if the change in formation adds more goals to Costa Rica in arguably the easiest group of the Gold Cup.

- #### **The Keylor Navas absence**

 Without a doubt the best player in CONCACAF, it's no question that Keylor's absence will be felt. Navas asked to not participate as his status at Real Madrid remains uncertain. Morreira will have the very difficult task of trying to fill his gloves, but he'll need some help from the experienced back line

 Mastostas said ***""He is not in the best [mental] condition to be in the national team. I was a player, I went through these moments, so Keylor has my full understanding and support moving forward.""***

Haiti, traditionally one of the strongest Caribbean nations, is **looking to bounce back from a disappointing exit from Gold Cup 2017 qualifying** where they lost the playoff to Nicaragua. They’ve gotten off to a good start so far, winning all of their qualifying games and finishing at the top of the CONCACAF Nation’s league qualification table. 

They will want to try to build on the success they had at the Gold Cup in 2015 where they advanced in second from a difficult group and made it to the quarter finals. They will most likely be battling Costa Rica and Nicaragua to advance and presents **an excellent opportunity for them to avenge their 2017 exit.**

 Nazon a tricky and creative attacker deployed primarily on the left where he can cut in. He’s linked up well with Etienne and scored 5 himself in their game against Sint Maarten. He is a driving force behind Haiti’s attack and will be one to keep an eye on

 in 26 matches for Haiti, Nazon has scored 16 goals, and despite barely getting a match with St. Mirren in the Scottish Premiership, he's still a key attacking player for Haiti



[](#icon-star-big) [**Derrick Etienne Jr. (ST)**](https://imgur.com/a/b5bu7yL)

 The 22 year old **Richmond, VA native** is Haiti's star man up top. Etienne will most likely be isolated for stretches of time and how he can get involved will be important for Haiti. He will also be an asset defensively with his workrate and underrated aerial ability.


[](#icon-star-big) [**Mechack Jérôme (CB)**](https://imgur.com/a/Jh67ob2)

 A **USL/NASL veteran,**  Jérôme is the most senior Haitian player with **62 caps**. He’ll be important to organizing Haiti’s defensive shape and keeping composure. Haiti will need him and his centreback partner (whether it be Adé or Jean-Baptiste) to stay focused coming up against guys like Nakhi Wells, Bryan Ruiz, etc. Even though he's a bit short for a centre back at 5'10"" (178 cm), he still manages to get the job done







---

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- #### **No Nazon no party**
 
 From what little footage there is available most of Haiti’s attacking play goes through Nazon. If he struggles to get into the game Haiti could be in trouble. T**hey don’t seem to have another player who can make something happen out of nothing quite like Nazon can.**

- #### **Don't play a high line against these guys!** 

 Again, through the little footage that was available of Haiti's matches, it seemed that one particular strength they have is getting through a high line on the break. In their recent [friendly against Chile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoScf1q2co), there were at least 3 to 5 times where one of the fullbacks played an inch perfect long ball up to one of the speedy frontman, breaking Chile's defensive line that was basically on the halfway line of the pitch. What they do after breaking that line is a bit questionable but they're good at getting through nonetheless. 


- #### **The fight for second place**
 
 Costa Rica are clear favorites to top the group and so **Haiti find likely find themselves in a fight with Nicaragua for second place**. They will be additionally motivated to get revenge their 2017 Gold Cup exit to Nicaragua and the Haiti-Nicaragua game will have a huge impact on the group’s final standings.

#[](#sprite6-p126) Introduction



 Nicaragua enter the Gold Cup with an unfamiliar feeling of hope as opposed to the cynical one they usual have. One of the poorer Latin-American footballing countries, Nicaragua has made the Gold Cup only two times prior, where they've lost all six of their matches, conceding 15 and scoring only one. **If you add on the CONCACAF Championship, they have a record of 0-1-14, with 6 GF and 42 GA. In nearly 60 years of the competition, Nicaragua have yet to win a match at the tournament**

 Though under the grizzled experience of manager Henry Duarte, Nicaragua have been steadily improving, reaching consecutive Gold Cups for the first time ever. In arguably the easiest group of the Gold Cup, can Nicaragua finally get themselves a win and maybe even reach the quarterfinals?

 The **country's all time leading goalscorer**, at 30 years old, Barrera is still in his prime and is a **crafty playmaker who can play anywhere across the front line**. With the second most caps in the 23 man squad, he is without doubt the star of the team and if Nicaragua score it'll probably go through him, whether he scores it or he's involved in the build up. He'll be leading his team out the tunnel as the captain for Nicaragua's second consecutive Gold Cup. **One of his best skills is drawing fouls in dangerous areas**, so don't try and get too handsy with Juan.

 Typically a RW for Iranian club Padideh, Chavarria has to play out left to accommodate for the captain Barrera. The 25 year old scored Nicaragua's lone goal at the 2017 Gold Cup, which gave them a short lived lead against Panama.

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- #### **Can they finally break their ABYSMAL Gold Cup rut?** 

 In the CONCACAF Gold Cup/Championship, **Nicaragua have previously competed 4 other times** in 1963, 1967, 2009, and 2017. Unfortunately, they have an absolutely horrible record at the tournament, **overall playing 15 games, they have gone 0-1-14, scoring only 6 goals and conceding a ridiculous 42 goals.** 

 During their **two previous Gold Cup appearances, Nicaragua have lost all six of their matches, scoring only one and conceding 15**. In a much much more favourable group and constant progress being shown under Duarte, can Nicaragua pull off a shocker and qualify for the last eight?

 At the very least, can they at least pick up their first point in the Gold Cup era? They'll certainly fancy their chances against both Haiti and Bermuda. They'll certainly be gunning for their first EVER win in the CONCACAF Gold Cup/Championship when they go head to head against Bermuda in Red Bull Arena on the 24th.

#[](#sprite6-p201) Introduction


 One of only **two debutantes at this year’s tournament**, Bermuda benefits from the expansion to 16 teams. After getting off to a poor start with a 3-1 loss to Aruba, the side rallied to collect the full 9 remaining points to finish on the upper side of the CNLQ standings, which included an [enormous upset victory over El Salvador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uUlKRkIl74) at home in Hamilton in the midst of terrible weather conditions, and a come from behind win on the road vs the Dominican Republic. Incredibly, the Gombey Warriors also **saw themselves place in League A of the region’s inaugural Nations League.**

 With a population of just **65,000 people**, The Atlantic island become the tournament's smallest ever competitor in terms of population size.

#[](#icon-info-big) Players to Watch

[](#icon-star-big) [**Nakhi Wells (ST)**](https://d3tbg3dlyesi70.cloudfront.net/1700x864_/media/17942/nahki_wells_bermuda_01.jpg) 

 Bermuda’s most important attacking threat this summer will come from the Queens Park Rangers (on loan from Burnley) man. The 29 year old has seven goals to his name, a few of which came in the CNL qualifying cycle. He’s been with Bermuda since 2007, and is regularly talked about as the country’s most promising player. If Bermuda is to come through a feasible group, he will have to come up big in their clashes with Haiti &amp; Nicaragua.


[](#icon-star-big) [**Dante Leverock (CB)**](https://imgur.com/a/WXtZFvD)

 The captain who plays his trade in the League of Ireland. Largely responsible for the Bermudan’s ability to grind out an improbable Gold Cup slot. **At 6'4"" (193 cm) and 190 lbs (86 kg)**, Leverock is the anchor at the back and his sheer ridiculous strength and aerial ability will be key when the islanders come up against heavily favored Costa Rica. Every set piece Bermuda get will be guided towards his head. Even with his massive stature, Leverock is pretty adept on the ball, though he most likely won't be bringing the ball out of the back as often as he does when with his club team, Leverock still has a mean long ball on him and can accurately ping one all the way from centre half.

 [Here is a 10 minute high quality highlight video of Leverock pinging long balls, dominating in the air, bringing the ball out the back, and much more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJH-tsQgNcI). Love a good CB highlight video and this is no different

#[](#icon-discuss-big) Points of Discussion

- #### **The darling underdogs**
 
 Kyle Lightbourne’s side could very well win the hearts of many this month, as they will undoubtedly be seen as the feel good story of the tournament. With Montserrat missing out by a whisker, Bermuda will likely fill the role of the underdog. The men from clubs of the likes of Robin Hood FC and PHC Zebra have the chance to turn heads and get neutrals to take an interest in football from the Atlantic island nation.

- #### **What are they truly made of?**

 This team now have a platform to prove their worth on a major international stage. We’ll find out if the Gombeys are up to par when they take on opposition in what will likely be a battle for second in Group B. Haiti will indeed be seen as the team to topple, but **Bermuda were still nonetheless handed a doable draw**. With a Nicaragua team that has failed to impress in previous editions, they certainly have an outside chance of nicking that second place spot.

231,Top 10 American Youth Soccer Tournament Attendees - people you will see at youth soccer tournaments.,"This is actually kind of funny. Hope you get a good laugh. Let me know which type you are! 

10. Crazy grandparents who scream at the referee and yell “boot it” nonstop: See grandparents are more dangerous than parents because they have very little skin in the game. They can land like a stealth bomber and leave without a trace.

9. Weekend softball guy who now coaches his daughter’s soccer team: He was all county baseball four times. He was All over 40 softball league three times. Still disappointed he has daughters, so he coaches them like he plays softball. He slides into first on every hit and expects his daughters to hit anything on the field that walks.

8. Overzealous referee: blows his whistle really hard. Hands out cards like candy. Let’s everyone know he is in charge and plans to ref in the World Cup with his grade 9 referee badge.

7. Super Soccer Team Mom: She makes sure faces are painted. Oranges are ready. Tunnel is set up post game on cue. Makes sure Little sally has her protein bars and gu packets for her u9 game. Super soccer team mom is really a gem but is so superstitious that if you got ants on a log as pregame snack and won...you will be getting that til you are 18.

6. Former super soccer team mom: She now is on her fourth kid playing club soccer. Her kid rarely has the right uniform. She passes out mimosas pregame to the parents. Makes sure the post-game hotel bar is stocked and ready to go. Literally the MVP of the parents on the team.

5. Assistant Coach Dad: Assistant coach dad has never played the game, but he is the co-pilot on the charter plane in case of emergency. Should head coach get tossed from game by 13-year-old referee...smash glass and use assistant coach dad to complete the mission.

4. Former European First Division professional dad: Actually, he played in the over 30 beer league but no one can find record of the Lithuanian pro leagues so fact checking is impossible. No matter what decision is made by the head coach...it is wrong.

3. Soccer Diva Family: First of all, the whole family wears matching club gear and drives a BMW with license plate that says soca4life. This family has had everything custom made and custom embroidered with player name and number on it. They have actually nicknamed their kid “Ronaldo.”

2. Overworked Tournament Administrator Volunteer: God bless this person because they have dedicated their time to making the tournament run. They have a heart of gold and intentions in the right place. Unfortunately, because of the aforementioned crazy people their nerves are shredded. They are like a landmine ready to explode at any moment.

1. Actual former college or pro soccer player parent: You can recognize them because they don’t interact with anyone. They sit by themselves and refuse to engage in conversation. Their deep stare is one of frustration and loss of empathy for all other US soccer parents.

266,Why FFP won't affect Madrid?,"Questions:
1) Why FFP won't affect Madrid?

2) Why didn't the club sign big names last season?

3) How the Bernabeu reconstruction budget will work with all the signings?

Answers:
1) The Financial Fair Play (FFP) renews from 1st day of July 2019. Thus, any signings before the said date will be registered in the 18/19 financial year.
Real Madrid haven't spent much of their money in previous transfer window and did complete some sales of players such as Cristiano Ronaldo for 100 million. FFP formula is based on ensuring that the clubs don't overspend than what they can generate. Thus, the ultimate goal of the rule is to keep the club in defined limits for spending by which they won't be going bankrupt.
In the case of Real Madrid, the club is allowed to spend 100 million of surplus on whatever sales they make. For example, if the club sells 2-3 players and generates 300 million from the transfers, the net amount allowed to be spent on the new signings will be 400 million for that financial year.
This puts the club in the clear advantage for this season where they divide the two financial years and keep separate accounts. From July onwards the club will be looking to offload a couple of players for some big money in order to balance out the finances and this may well put the club in a condition to sign yet another Galactico for a considerable amount of money which may exceed 150-200 million mark.
However, the club may have to sell some players before 1st July as well. The reason being the club has already spent around 250 million on Hazard, Jovic, Militao, and Mendy. The previous windows also witnessed the arrival of Courtois, Brahim Díaz, and Mariano. Thus, a sale of around 50-60 million may need to be made for the current financial year which ends on 31st day of June 2019.
2) This may reflect why the club was patient in the last season to analyse the situation before making any haphazard decisions. The quality of the squad and the depth were closely observed while the financial situation was also taken care off. The players which the club chose wouldn't have been signed last year as Luka Jović the promising talent was only recognized after the end of the season as promising talent who scored 27 goals in Bundesliga. Same was the case with Militao and Mendy. Eden Hazard, however was always willing to join Real Madrid but it was tough negotiating the Chelsea who finally let go of the Belgian after his request. Moreover, Chelsea wouldn't allow Real Madrid to purchase two of their star players, Courtois and Hazard, within the same window.
3) The Santiago Bernabeu loyalists were earlier worried that the reconstruction project may hinder their transfers but that will not be the case as the club has reached a financial deal with multinational business, Legends who’ve worked on Yankee Stadium &amp; AT&amp;T Stadium etc. Their business plan outlines a strategy to earn €150m yearly from the Bernabeu after it’s reconstruction.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch &amp; JP Morgan have agreed to grant Real Madrid a €575m (2.5% interest) loan that will involve Spanish banks including Santander &amp; CaixaBank for a 30 year (annual payment of €25m) financing period for the new Bernabeu renovations.
The stadium is officially due for completion in October 2022.
Thus, the Annual EMI payment of 25 million for 30-35 years will be made by the club as it shall earn approximately 150 million yearly from the renovated stadium. Which would mean that after paying off the annual EMI, the club will still have 125 million yearly revenue in surplus.
Hence, the Bernabeu reconstruction project is completely separate from the transfer accounts of Real Madrid and both have no interference whatsoever.

Conclusion:

Florentino Masterclass. Not disturbing the club's finance budget while getting profit and renovation done all together. With no sponsor renaming or whatsoever. And creating a ruckus by signing a world class dream team. Beauty!

7,Your personal favourite player of each nationality,"Thought this would be a fun thread. Simply just name your personal favourite player of each nationality. 

**Portuga**l: Even though he's not from my time it has to be Eusébio, for obvious reasons. But as far as players I actually grew up watching play it has to be Figo. He was our hope back in 1996-2006. Remember that Portugal did not begin to qualify for every Euro and World Cup until 2000. Before that we had only played in the 1966 and 1986 World Cups and in the the 1984 and 1996 Euros. 

**Spain**: Raúl, I'd say. Always liked him. 

**France**: Don't have a French player among my favourites so it's hard to say, but I'm gonna go with Robert Pires. He played for a great Arsenal team and was also of Portuguese ancestry and his father is a big Benfica fan. Pires even said at some point he'd like to have played for Benfica in the later years of his career. Sadly that never happened. 

**Germany**: Neuer. 

**Italy**: Oh tough one. I've liked quite a few Italian players throughout my life. Gonna say Pipo Inzaghi, however.

**Holland**: Also a tough one. But gonna go with Pierre van Hooijdonk. 

**England**: Like France, I don't have an English player among my favourites, but I'm gonna go with Jamie Vardy. I did like Michael Owen a lot when I was a kid, though. 

**Slovenia**: Oblak, easily.

**Greece:** Probably Karagounis. Least favourite would be Charisteas FOR OBVIOUS REASONS REEEEEEEEEEEEEE

**Czech Republic**: Nedved, followed by Porborky and Milan Baros. Loved that golden generation of theirs. 

**Sweden:** Henrik Larsson. 

**Romania:** Gheorghe Hagi, even though he was already old as shit when I began watching football. 

**Turkey**: Hakan Sukur because I find his name cool sounding. 

**Wales:** Giggs, easily.

**Ukraine**: Shevchenko, of course! Loved that guy.

**Brazil**: JONAS PISTOLAS!

**Argentina**: Pablo Aimar. But ofc I like Messi as well.

**Paraguay**: ~~Larissa Riquelme~~  Oscar ""Tacuara"" Cardozo, of course!

**Uruguay**: Luiz Suaréz

**Canada**: Fernando Aguiar, the Robocop. 

**Australia**: Tim Cahill. Always love seeing Australia in the World Cup. One of my favourite neutral national teams. And Tim Cahill is the face of their NT to me. 

**Japan**: Kojiro Hyuga. Dem tiger shots. 

Can't think of other nations that have a player I particularly like(d). What about you?",soccer,1559498756,Marsupilami_316,11,1,True,2019-06-02

19,[Opinion] Buying/Selling players defeats the purpose of clubs,"No harsh feelings. Just something that came to mind recently and wanted to share, and see what people think about it.

To me, a ""club"" is essentially a certain region having its own team. A Liverpool club would be comprised of people from Liverpool. A Southampton club would be comprised of people from Southampton, etc. 

The rivalry is essentially based on locals from one city/region, versus locals from another region, as to determine the winners and thereby the ""best in the country/league"".

It's similar to a school contest. One school versus another school, both comprised of their respective students. It would be odd to see a school ""buying"" students from another school to represent them.

I see clubs in the same way. It defeats the purpose to form a club based in one region, out of players that aren't from that region.

I know there are certain nuances to take into count, like moving there and so forth, however the general foundation of what clubs meant seems lost to me in this day and time.",soccer,1559499599,LeopoldMashallah,97,0,True,2019-06-02

In the light of the \[scandalous African Champions League final\]([https://streamable.com/56qxo](https://streamable.com/56qxo)) that took place 2 days ago in Tunisia between Esperance and Wydad, we want to reach out to FIFA and express loudly and clearly our concerns about the future of Football in the African Continent. We want an investigation to be opened and justice brought back to African Football.

Corruption is taking over the game we are passionate about and everyone saw what happened during the African Champions League Final 2019 on both the first and second legs where the Championship was stolen by the African Confederation of Football in collaboration with corrupted referees.

59,Who could be a future FIFA member? Palau (20/25),"Now, today's choice may seem like a strange one to those in the know. Leaving FSM until tomorrow and bringing in Palau first? However, Palau has the infrastructure, just the money (and possibly the interest) holding them back. FSM has additional challenges which we'll get to tomorrow. But, I have to try and make the switch from football to soccer as we enter Micronesia proper with one of the Compact nations. This close association with the USA means they have affected some of the language...

**Palau**

https://i.redd.it/umaz60zewz131.png

Palau is a Micronesian nation with a reputation for being one of the most environmentally friendly countries, including banning certain sun screens to preserve the coral reefs. Palau or Belau or the Pelew islands were rarely considered, with vague control by Spain, Imperial Germany and Japan. Palau was liberated through the brutal Battle of Peleliu by the USA and spent some time as a Trust territory of Micronesia under the USA. Independence was gained in 1994, under the Compact of Free Association, in which the USA gives them some rights in the US and money in exchange for land for military bases.

Football isn’t a very popular sport in Palau and a somewhat mysterious one, with little evidence throughout but something of a league running occasionally from 2004, typically recently, including a youth league in 2016. Records are fragmented, but few Palauans competed in the senior league, Team Bangladesh (Bangladeshi citizens living in Palau) being the most successful team. Local sides participated in football in the Belau Games (the local name for Palau) but records are hard to come by. The multi-purpose stadium does satisfy international requirements, but baseball remains far more popular.

The national team has only participated in the Micronesian Games when football was played, finishing 3rd in the shorter 7-a-side games in 1998 (beating non-native Palauans Palau-B in the 3rd place match after previously losing to them), 2nd in 2014 after crowd funding to get there (losing to Pohnpei from FSM twice) and 3rd in 2018 (losing all 3 group games but beating FSM’s Chuuk for 3rd place). They’ve tried to join the EAFF to get into the AFC but the AFC and the OFC have both directed Palau to the other confederation…

If Palauans were interested in the sport, they are in a good place to join either OFC or the AFC and then FIFA, but the interest might not be there. Very hard to tell due to poor records but the fact that they have played at all, considering the serious financial issues that beset the federation, is incredible.

They have a manager in Ancelotti who has been with the giants of football and I'm assuming is aiming to reach that same glory with Napoli. They still have goals to be achieved, like winning the Serie A or getting late into the knockout stages of the Champions League. And last but not least they have talent - lots of talent - particularly in Koulibaly, Allan, Insigne, Milik, and Mertens. I personally think they're one more top-class CB and midfielder away from being serious contenders to win the Serie A.

212,Mesut Özil: The truth,"So, I've just realized a very dark conspiracy about Ozil that needs to be revealed. This explains why people think he's so good when it's obvious to anyone that watches that he's lazy and shit.  

**Section 1: The ""Highlights""**

Have any of us *actually* seen Ozil play a good game? No. How is it then that there are thousands of highlight reels on Youtube showcasing his apparent ""talents"" in ways that other players would find unimaginable. For example this [technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a73YFjTZUeg) he does where he seems to push the ball into the ground.

It is obvious that this, Ozil's flicks, backheels, etc.(which *seem* to exude qulaity and genius) are nothing more than the products of subtle **video editing**. We are seeing the beginning of **deep fake** technology which are pushing out ""evidence"" that Ozil is a world class player. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP-lkO25X_0) famous video of his  ""bubble gum skills"" for example is totally doctored. A mere animation meant to make Ozil ""look"" like some kind of technical God.

**Section 2--The media and Bot network**

How is it that Ozil has been called, on numerous occasions by numerous managers and  players, one of the best in the world when he is not even good enough for Europa league bound Arsenal? How has such a lazy, overpaid player managed to secure such an impeccable reputation.

The answer, simply, is fake news. As we saw in the 2016 USA election, bot networks are a real thing now. There are thousdands of ""Ozil bots"" dedicated to making comments attesting to his quality. They have even infiltrated the likes of Sky Sports and BBC, affecting statistical databases and more. This is how Ozil has built this image for himself as world class, this is the power of fake news.

Finally,

**SECTION 3- The Erdoğan Connection**

The question is why? What is the motive for this massive act of deception on the footballing world? The answer lies with turkish President, who Ozil has recently been pictured with on multiple occasions, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Ozil is Erdogan's plant in London, he is a man here for espionage alone. The only proper thing to do is report him to mi6 and cut our losses. A plague entered our football club in 2014 from Real Madrid, it is time to cut it out.

214,"Now it's wrapped up, let's stop and appreciate what an AWESOME Champions League campaign it was...","Think about it:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Ajax knock out Real Madrid (reigning, 3 time Champions) at the Bernabau, with Ramos watching from the sidelines happy to serve his suspension in the belief that they'd make it through. So confident was he, that he had the camera crew there filming his doco. And instead we'll get to enjoy watching his face as Real get knocked out of Europe by Ajax.

\- Billionaire PSG= bottled it.

\- Billionaire Man City= knocked out by a team who were supposed to bottle it.

\- Coutinho knocked out in the awe-inspiring 4-0 turnaround at Anfield, by the very same team he left at the start of last year because he wanted to win CL trophies.

\- Two teams who the haters derided all the way as ""bottlers"", instead staged incredible fight-backs or unbelievable last second wins in the semis, to make the biggest annual Final in world football.

\- In the final itself, Mo Salah, who left the field just 30 minutes into last years' Final thanks to Ramos's grub act, steps up just 2 minutes into the game and puts his team 1 goal up. He goes on to play the full-match, injury free.

#[](#icon-news-big) Hopes and Overall Grades

###**Hopes/Predictions at the start of the season?**


- *Personally hoping for us to* ***win something, compete in Europe and continue to be competitive in the title race.*** *The big target was to avoid the drop-off that so many defending Champions experience and to not succumb to complacency after steamrolling the league last season.*

- *Hope was to* ***retain the PL.*** *That's my first and foremost hope, and I had a feeling it'll be close with Liverpool, but I wouldn't have predicted that we'll finish at 98 points. We'll win one of League Cup or FA Cup, and don't really have prediction for CL honestly.*

- ***Retain the title*** - *but failing that, finish second and win a cup double. After how wonderful the 17/18 was, and looking at how much of a dominant statement of intent it was, 18/19 had to follow through on what we’d promised and set out the stall for the future. 17/18 was the best season I’ve ever known as a City fan, but for the club to join the elite we had to go big again and prove that we could be dominant for years to come.*






###**Season Grade + Review**


- **A** *I don’t think anyone can suggest that it hasn’t been an* ***unmitigated success. No team in English history has won a domestic treble***, *we’re the first team to successfully defend the Prem since United in 2009 and our level has managed to stay so remarkably consistent. True, there are the old nagging doubts about Europe, but given how we fought back from a 3-1 aggregate deficit and that we were a narrow VAR call off the semi-finals, I think it was far from a disaster.*

- **A** *The team was excellent domestically. A lot of players stepped up to bring the team forward, most notably Bernardo and Laporte.* ***The team also showed some resilience that they didn't have to show last season because they won by so much, and it was impressive to see how well this team could play in three competitions knowing that they basically had to win out.*** *All that said, the UCL tie against Tottenham showed that we still have some work to do in Europe.*

- **9/10** *I couldn't possibly have hoped that we would achieve a domestic treble, and there were several moments throughout the season where I was certain Liverpool would run out eventual winners in the league. To fight off such a contender while not only contesting, but winning the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup is in my opinion an unprecedented level of performance that shows our squad hasn't eased up after the way we breezed through the league last season.* ***I am thoroughly satisfied, but I would be lying if I said the CL quarterfinal exit*** *didn't hurt a lot, even more so when it came at the hands of a very beatable team.* ***Had we gotten to the semis in Europe it would be hard for me not to have given a 10 out of 10.***

- **10/10** *Look, this season* ***wasn’t absolutely 100% perfect, but we became the first team in English football history to win the domestic treble and we were a couple of controversial VAR decisions away from a Champions League semi-final.*** *It’s almost completely unrealistic to expect a domestic treble, and we got that, so it would just be unfair to mark us down for not completing the quadruple. So many players have roles in this team that I never expected them to, and it’s all down to how well we’ve worked as a unit this year. I wish Christmas hadn’t happened, losing to Chelsea, Palace, Leicester and Newcastle was frustrating. But not every season can be perfect.*






###**Manager Grade + Review**

- **A** *Pep can simply* ***do no wrong in my eyes and the eyes of the fanbase. The simply astonishing thing is how our performance didn’t really drop off from last season.*** *He ensured that the team kept their focus and maintained their composure during the difficult late-game period, all without key players like de Bruyne and (in the last few games) Fernandinho. There’s a reason why so many of us were rattled by the recent ‘Pep to Juve’ rumours that now (thankfully) seem to have dispersed – he’s that good.*

- **A** *Sterling has grown so much under him, Bernardo as well.* ***Think this season he showed that he's able to be more pragmatic in games, such as the Liverpool game at Anfield.*** *There are some interesting tactics as well like Fernandinho as a CB-DM combo against Arsenal if I recall. There are faults, of course, but Pep shows that he can still improve, and that should scare other teams.*

- **10/10** *I’m not sure how many City fans would ever be comfortable admitting this because of what it could potentially mean for the club when he eventually leaves, but* ***Pep is City right now. It’s set up entirely for him, it’s working so well because of him, his philosophy is our identity as a team, the players respect him and love him.*** *He’s everything we wanted and more.*

- **10/10** *Pep's the best the world has ever seen and this was another magnificent season. Realistically,* ***you could say he has made one mistake all season, and it seems contentious among City fans if it was his mistake at all, but the away leg against Tottenham in the CL was horrendous in my opinion.*** *Cup competitions are volatile by nature though, for example that missed penalty would have changed everything.* 

 *He got everything spot on in the home leg of that same tie, but two mistakes from the second-best defender in the Premier League gave Tottenham the win, and* ***there's not really a lot Pep can do about individual mistakes like that. His subs are usually spot-on. When he makes surprising changes to the starting XI they usually pan out much better than expected.*** *His rotation of the squad is excellent bar Fernandinho in the first half of the season. I would take Pep on a lifetime contract, in all honesty.*

#[](#icon-notes-big) The XI


###**Best/Most Used XI + Tactics**

                             Ederson

              Walker   Kompany   Laporte   Zinchenko    
           
                           Fernandinho   

                   Gündoğan            D. Silva

             B. Silva                        Sterling

                              Agüero

 



 *Can't rightly include* **De Bruyne** *with his injuries, but he'd be there in place of Gundo if he had had a fit season.*

 *The* ***defence was prone to change throughout the season*** *(sometimes* **Stones** *or* **Otamendi** *was in for Kompany and Danilo in for Walker etc) and Gündoğan  can fill the Fernandinho slot with De Bruyne in Gündoğan’s slot whenever he was fit.*

 *Tactics are the usually Pep possession-based football, with everyone high up the pitch and wingers staying wide to stretch the defence.* ***Honestly, there’s not normally much deviation from these tactics, but they are pretty damn effective.***

 **Walker** *concerns me a little defensively, but Danilo didn't play enough this season to warrant putting him over Walker.* 

  **Kompany** *over Stones because he was big for us down the stretch.* 

 **Zinchenko** *earned his place at LB, and I think next season he will get even better.* 

 **Fernandinho** *is an ageless wonder.* 

 **Sterling** gets better every year and will be one of the best forwards in the world for years to come.* 

 **Aguero**'s *combination of power, accuracy and his ability to get a shot off with a minimal amount of space is incredible.*

 ***Sterling plays a lot on the left this season with Bernardo on the right***, *as opposed to last season. It proves to work fairly well, with Sterling cutting in a lot from the wide area and to finish the chances. Honestly if Mendy were fit, he'll undoubtedly be there. He shows he can be defensively solid like the game against Liverpool, and his crossing is incredible. Zinchenko did very well and reliable unexpectedly, and everyone will now trust him at LB.*

#[](#icon-ball-big) Best/Worst Match and Goal of the Season


###**Best Match of the Season:** [**Manchester City 2-1 Liverpool**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mz9Uyq2iiA) and [**Manchester City 6-0 Chelsea**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWX3DaQn77s)

 **[On Liverpool Match]** 

- *That Aguero goal showcased why he has been such a force for so many years. The Sane goal was also brilliant and highlighted why we should try to keep him.*

**[On Chelsea Match]**

- *Home and dry inside twenty minutes against a team who played quite well and still ended up on the end of such a huge scoreline. This had Aguero’s screamer, two from Sterling, and was defined throughout by the most powerful football we’ve ever played under Pep. An absolute masterclass from start to finish.*


###**Worst Match of the Season:** [**Newcastle 2-1 Manchester City**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuD6tAKi2II)


 *Obviously things worked out just fine in the end, but* ***that night felt like the end of the title race for me***, *and that we’d been pushed one step too far to retain the league title and that it just wasn’t going to happen. Newcastle weren’t particularly good either, we were just so abject.*

 *Maybe complacency. A good* ***wake up call anyway***, *and one that thankfully is not capitulated by Liverpool.*

 Honourable mention to the [1-2 draw against Lyon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMDJ5UsVllo), which *really highlighted how vulnerable we could be to counterattacks, and unfortunately the flaws still plagued us later in the competition.*

Also the [1-2 loss at Leicester on Boxing Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyahNzJBA9k) : *Conceding after going ahead AGAIN, not looking anywhere near our usual selves and the growing sense that we were going to lose as the second half minutes ticked away, compounded with Leicester’s (deserved) fantastic winning goal.*








###[](#icon-ball) **Goal of the Season:** [V. Kompany vs LEI 70'](https://streamable.com/mq8fj)

*VINNYYYY*

 *Truly the send off that the captain deserved.*

 Other mentions to 

 - [Aguero vs Chelsea](https://streamable.com/sxa81)
  
 *Kompany’s goal against Leicester will rightly take this crown, but there are no words for how well Sergio struck that screamer against Chelsea.* 
 
 *I saw it live inside the Etihad Stadium and I still can’t believe anything about it. He had virtually no space and was surrounded by Chelsea players, and he had barely any room to generate backlift, yet the angle at which it entered the goal was unbelievably accurate. It should have dipped just before crossing the line, like all shots from distance do,* ***but it just kept rising and rising and rising at increasing speed until it smacked into the very top corner. I’ll never forget it.***

#[](#icon-trophy-big) Season Awards

-  [](#icon-star-big) **Goalkeeper of the Season:** [**Ederson**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/12707/Ederson/overview)

 *Who else? With the passing ability of Beckham to place 50 yard passes, and the goalkeeping skills that most of the times lead him to rush out of the penalty box.*

 *Once again, for the second season in a row, he’s been absolutely superb;* ***passing the ball around the back with a hitherto unseen confidence and saving us on several occasions.*** *See how quickly he managed to [close down Roberto Pereya at 0-0 in the Cup Final](https://streamable.com/9l58j) to see a prime example of how important he is for us. I was so glad to see him in Team of the Season –* ***he’s been brilliant.***


 


- [](#icon-star-big) **Defender of the Season:** [**Aymeric Laporte**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/11044/Aymeric-Laporte/overview)

 *What a feller.* ***Rising up to become the main defender in less than a season.*** *As people said he's not the quickest, but his defending intelligence is very good. At that to his passing and scoring header goals, it's an easy choice really.*

 *Perhaps not the most unbeatable CB in the world, but still a superb defender and great with his feet.*

 *He* ***hasn't been given the best conditions with his CB partner constantly changing but he has been magnificent.*** *Honorable mention to Walker for his insane run of form during the last stages of our season.*

 *After slowly becoming more influential in the latter half of last season, he’s been Pep’s* ***cast-iron starter in defence, being our most formidible defender and being an aerial threat from set pieces.*** *All three goals he scored this season (v Wolves, Everton and Brighton) were very important ones and he’s cemented his place in the backline for, hopefully, seasons to come.*

 



- [](#icon-star-big) **Midfielder of the Season:** [**Bernardo Silva**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/5067/Bernardo-Silva/overview)

 ***I know he plays a lot in wings***, *but him being able to so smoothly replace KDB for a lot of the season playing in midfield is one of our saving grace. The David Silva and Kante love child is easily becoming a fan favorite.*

 *Excellent both in terms of creating chances and putting in the work defensively. A tireless worker and one of the best midfielders in Europe this season.*

 ***It's a little bit of cheating*** *but I'm gonna go with Bernardo even though he probably played most of his games on the wing. He's got the stamina, the skill, the desire. Everything you want in a top player.*

 ***I’m slightly cheating here as he’s mainly played on the wing***, but Bernardo has been utterly brilliant this season, becoming the focal point of our attack and being undroppable from start to finish, earning our Player of the Season award.* ***Without Bernardo, I doubt we win the title with Kevin out – he’s been so important.***

 *Also a small shout-out to* **İlkay Gündoğan**, *who stepped up admirably in Fernandinho’s absence in the latter half of the season and has been an extremely reliable player in amidst the midfield injuries we had. Really, really hope he stays.*

 




 

- [](#icon-star-big) **Forward of the Season:** [**Sergio Agüero**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/4328/Sergio-Ag%C3%BCero/overview)

 ***It’s between him and Sterling***, *but I just have to give it to Agüero for* ***his remarkable consistency***. *Yet again, he’s broken the 20-goal barrier and come up with some vitally important goals. Without goals against [Liverpool](https://streamable.com/oivoz), [Brighton](https://streamable.com/h0bgs), [Burnley](https://streamable.com/ekdad), [West Ham](https://streamable.com/ioq8s) etc, who knows where we end up?* ***He’s an absolute legend of the club.***

 *Has scored some crucial goals and a few worldies mixed in as usual. Sterling is very good. Fantastic, even. But he hasn't got the* ***Kun-factor.***

 *As great as Sterling was,* ***Agüero scored big goals*** *(particularly against Burnley and Liverpool) that were crucial to us winning the league.*

 *Maybe forward of the decade, more like.* ***Changed his style, and becomes a more complete player.*** *Mr Reliable that increases our chances of winning by a whole lot if he plays. Obviously Sterling has had a brilliant season, but it's my choice, so always Agüero.*

 The Argentine just turned 31 and got **32 goals and 10 assists in 46 matches** in all competitions this season, and **his fifth straight season with at least 20 goals in the league**

 As mentioned above, **Raheem Sterling** has also been magnificent, getting **25 goals and 18 assists in 51 matches in all competitions** this season
 

- [](#icon-star-big) **Signing of the Season:** [**Riyad Mahrez (£59.90 million)**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/8983/Riyad-Mahrez/overview)

 *No contest here as Mahrez was* ***our only signing this season.*** *Mahrez has* ***struggled to make a huge impact, with many fans calling for him to be benched***; *he didn’t help matters by skying his late penalty at Anfield into orbit. I do think he’s improved as the season has gone on though and the last few games, he really seemed to be clicking – I think he was arguably MOTM against Brighton, where he scored the goal to essentially seal the title.*

 The Algerian got **12 goals and 12 assists in 44 matches** in all competitions this season

  




- [](#icon-star-big) **U-23 Player of the Season:** [**Oleksandr Zinchenko**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/19620/Oleksandr-Zinchenko/overview)

 *Back in August,* ***most of us were pretty disappointed that Zinchenko decided to stay here instead of going on loan to Wolves, feeling like his chances of starting were slim.*** *Remakably, Zinchenko has* ***morphed into a fantastic LB, being Pep’s go-to choice, given the mistakes of Delph and the absence of Mendy.*** *Playing out of his skin, Zinny got himself a well-deserved, new contract this season and could well fight Mendy for starting LB next season.*

 *The guy has* ***absolutely made the left back position his own***, *and did it after speculation in the summer that he was gonna go to Wolves. I cannot help but admire him for turning down a (on paper) wonderful move to a great club just so he could fight for a spot here at City. Nothing but respect, and the guy leaves it all on the pitch, even if his defending is suspect every so often.*

 *Shout-out to* **Phil Foden**, *who flourished in the cup competitions and* ***repaid Pep’s faith in him, with a winning goal in a vital match against Spurs this season.*** *I hope he continues to develop and challenge for a starting place.*


 



- [](#icon-down-big) **Disappointment of the Season:** [**Champions League loss vs Spurs**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiuiVtg0Dq8) and [**Benjamin Mendy**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/5575/Benjamin-Mendy/overview)

 **[On UCL vs Spurs]**


 - *An absolutely* ***gut wrenching game that highlighted some of our greatest strengths as well as our greatest weaknesses.*** *The lone blemish on what was otherwise an unbelievable season.*

 - *God damn it, the* ***extreme high to extreme low***. *I'm more okay if we have lost against Spurs without that last minute goal.*


 **[On Benjamin Mendy]**

 - *Last season, he started well and got a horrendous injury against Palace that curtailed his last season, so* ***I had high hopes for him this season***. *Sadly, he hasn’t really gotten going, flitting in and out of the squad, and it* ***hasn’t helped that he doesn’t seem to take it all that seriously, with news stories that he was banned from his phone at the CFA.*** *The club seems to have faith he can still make an impact going forward, but I’m a little more skeptical after this season.*

 In the **10 matches** Mendy played this season in the league, **he got 5 assists**

244,"Croatian Football Union Awards: Luka Modrić best Croatian player for 7th year straight; Dani Olmo best player in Croatian 1st League, Livaković best goalkeeper","These are the awards given by Croatian Association Football Union (member of FifPro) and voted by all the players and coaches in Croatian 1st League (1.

425,Mesut Özil: The truth,"o, I've just realized a very dark conspiracy about Ozil that needs to be revealed. This explains why people think he's so good when it's obvious to anyone that watches that he's lazy and shit.  

**Section 1: The ""Highlights""**

Have any of us *actually* seen Ozil play a good game? No. How is it then that there are thousands of highlight reels on Youtube showcasing his apparent ""talents"" in ways that other players would find unimaginable. For example this [technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a73YFjTZUeg) he does where he seems to push the ball into the ground.

It is obvious that this, Ozil's flicks, backheels, etc.(which *seem* to exude qulaity and genius) are nothing more than the products of subtle **video editing**. We are seeing the beginning of **deep fake** technology which are pushing out ""evidence"" that Ozil is a world class player. 

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP-lkO25X_0) famous video of his  ""bubble gum skills"" for example is totally doctored. A mere animation meant to make Ozil ""look"" like some kind of technical God.

**Section 2--The media and Bot network**

How is it that Ozil has been called, on numerous occasions by numerous managers and  players, one of the best in the world when he is not even good enough for Europa league bound Arsenal? How has such a lazy, overpaid player managed to secure such an impeccable reputation.

The answer, simply, is fake news. As we saw in the 2016 USA election, bot networks are a real thing now. There are thousdands of ""Ozil bots"" dedicated to making comments attesting to his quality. They have even infiltrated the likes of Sky Sports and BBC, affecting statistical databases and more. This is how Ozil has built this image for himself as world class, this is the power of fake news.

Finally,

**SECTION 3- The Erdoğan Connection**

The question is why? What is the motive for this massive act of deception on the footballing world? The answer lies with turkish President, who Ozil has recently been pictured with on multiple occasions, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Ozil is Erdogan's plant in London, he is a man here for espionage alone. The only proper thing to do is report him to mi6 and cut our losses. A plague entered our football club in 2014 from Real Madrid, it is time to cut it out.

**Dropped ball - Laws 8 &amp; 9**

* If play is stopped inside the penalty area, the ball will be dropped for the goalkeeper
* If play is stopped outside the penalty area, the ball will be dropped for one player of the team that last touched the ball at the point of the last touch
* In all cases, all the other players (of both teams) must be at least 4m (4.5yds) away
* If the ball touches the referee (or another match official) and goes into the goal, team possession changes or a promising attack starts, a dropped ball is awarded

**Free-kicks - Law 13**

* When there is a ‘wall’ of three or more defenders, the attackers are not allowed within 1m (1 yd) of the wall; an attacker less than 1m (1yd) from the ‘wall’ when the kick is taken will be penalised with an indirect free-kick
* When the defending team takes a free-kick in their own penalty area, the ball is in play once the kick is taken; it does not have to leave the penalty area before it can be played",soccer,1559582141,fxckingboring,32,72,True,2019-06-03
2,A local's perspective on Europa League Final,"I've been reading posts about Europa League final and since I'm from Azerbaijan, I'd like to write a few things about it. Because everybody seems to ready to shit on us. 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I'm not a supporter of our government. It's corrupt as hell. However, UEFA was the one that gave final to Azerbaijan and nobody knew final would be between two English clubs. On the other hand, It's not like Azerbaijani people are thrilled for the final.   

&amp;#x200B;

Second of all, We aren't evil people who want to butcher everybody. Azerbaijan is a safe country to visit. Nobody is going to kill you. There are so many expats live in here and they have much more comfortable lives than locals. :D Armenia and Azerbaijan are in a political war for years now but honestly, I don't have any problem with Armenians.

51,Who could be a future FIFA member? St Pierre &amp; Miquelon (10/25),"Don't worry, we're leaving France tomorrow for a time. Yes, I'm relieved too. Somewhat suspicious though, isn't it? Most of the British territories got in, most of Overseas France has been left out. Though, in some cases, this is for good reason, case in point being St Pierre and Miquelon, today's subject!

**St Pierre and Miquelon**

[Official and Unofficial flags](https://i.redd.it/9h33y011k0031.png)

Yes, this is the last French “Caribbean” territory, don’t worry. Plenty more Overseas France to come though. Home of probably the trickiest flag to draw on the planet (sadly it is unofficial), these two tiny islands sit just off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada. The least populated part of Overseas France, it is mainly dependant on fishing and Canada. The only significant news about the island is probably that Marine Le Pen did some election campaigning there, which is sort of like counting on Gibraltar to swing the Brexit vote.

AS Ilienne Amateur dominate the local league of 3 teams, with each team playing each other 8 times in a season. Miquelon isn’t as populated but there is a team from there and they have taken at least 2 titles since 1976 when the league began. Teams debuted in the Coupe de France this season, with AS Saint Pierraise losing 2-1 to a 7th tier side. The national side only has played 7 games, all in the Coupe de l'Outre-Mer (in 2010 and 2012), conceding 78 goals in 7 games and scoring only 2. Their narrowest loss was 7-0 to French Guiana, their widest was 16-1 to New Caledonia.

Considering the national side is totally inactive, even CONCACAF membership is possibly out of reach, though the increased club activity is encouraging. They would probably have to ground-share on nearby Nova Scotia in Canada if they were allowed in.

97,In regard of the Mkhitaryan controversy: The root cause of the conflict between Armenians and Azeri,"In recent weeks there have been a lot of discussions about Mkhitaryan not willing to play the EL final in Baku because the lack of safety for him. And also Azerbaijan's unwillingness to hand out visas for fans with Armenian surnames. While I normally don't write about politics in this sub I am of the opinion that there are some cases where it is necessary to do so because sports and politics intermingle more often than most people wish. So what is the cause for the bloody conflict between Armenians and Azeris? First of all it's not a historically deep lying issue. Actually, it is a fairly recent one, dating back to the 19th century. Forgive me dear readers for simplifying certain events for the sake of shortening this writeup.


Let's start with the Armenians. Armenia has a very old history but despite this fact they only were really independent for several rather short times, unluckily being sandwiched between stronger empires. Greeks, Romans and Ottomans in the West, Russians in the North, Arabs in the South and Persians in the East. So far I can remember only one instance where nearly all Armenians were [united into one state](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Armenian_Empire.png) under the leadership of Tigranes the Great. As already stated this souvereignity did not held long and soon Armenia was the battleground between Rome and Persia, serving as some kind of buffer zone, each empire vying for dominance in that region. In the early 4th century AD there were two very important events which shaped the Armenian identity until today: the adoption of Christianity as state religion (actually the first country in the world to do so) and the development of the unique Armenian alphabet. With the rise of the Umayyad Caliphate large parts of Armenia became part of their large empire. But despite the overlordship of the muslim Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties, Armenians mostly retained their christian religion. In the Middle Ages the region was ravaged first by Seljuk Turks who mostly settled in Anatolia and later the Mongols and their successor states who controlled large parts of the Middle East.

In the 16th century Armenia was contested between two new growing empires, the turkish Ottoman dynasty in the West and the persian Safavid dynasty in the East. While Western Armenia was situated in today's turkish Eastern Anatolia, Eastern Armenia around today's capital Erevan was controlled by Persia for several centuries. The situation in Eastern Armenia changed with the expansionism of the Russian Empire which was trying to assert control of the Caucasus region in the early 19th century. Persia was unable to contest the russian expansion and within a few decades lost control.

The situation for Armenians in Russia and Turkey wasn't ideal but they were able to prosper to a certain degree. They were renowned for their entrepeneurial skills and many of them did hold high positions in both empires. But of course their success also raised suspicions from their overlords. But before we finally jump into modern times and the root for the Armenian-Azeri conflict let's take a short look on the history of Azerbaijan.

The name Azerbaijan is also quite old but actually it wasn't related to the lands of the modern republic. The origin of the name dates back to a certain powerful persian vassal named Atropates who ruled over parts in nowaday's Northwestern Iran. With Alexander the Great's conquest of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, the so called *Kingdom of Atropatene* became a Greek vassal but after some time it was able to declare independence. But not for long since the reemerging Persian Empire under the Arsacid and later Sassanid dynasties were able to conquer this area. In this time the name of the kingdom changed to *Aturpatakan* which in turn developed over centuries to *Adurbadagan* and then finally to *Azarbaydjan*. Like Armenians, Azeri living in the north (around Baku) mostly embraced christianity while the Azeris who lived in the southern region around Tabriz (in Northern Iran) were Zoroastrians. This changed with the rise of the Arabs in the Middle East. Under Arab rule the vast majority of the Azeri population became muslim although this was not done in a few years, actually it took many generations. Another deep impact was the conquest of Seljuk Turks in the 11th century. While genetically the change wasn't as deep as usually thought by some scholars it brought a major impact on their language. It's the reason why Azerbaijani belongs to the Turkic language family. And finally there was another deep impact on religion since the Persian Safavid dynasty embraced Shia Islam in the 16th century which is the reason why modern Azeri are mostly Shiites unlike the vast majority of muslims, who are Sunni. Like Eastern Armenia, Northern Azerbaijan was conquered by the Russian Empire in the early 19th century.

In the end of the 19th century there was a global rise of nationalism which brought many problems for multi-ethnic empires like Austria-Hungary or the Ottoman Empire. In Anatolia there were [millions of Armenians living within the Ottoman state*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Ethnic_map_of_Asia_Minor_and_Caucasus_in_1914.jpg) but with the crumbling power of the *Sublime Porte* in world politics, the Greek independence and the loss of large portions of its european holdings, the repercussions for the Armenian minority in Turkey were pretty severe. Under the reign of the so called *Bloody Sultan* Abdul Hamid II, hundreds of thousands Armenians were killed. Things became even worse in World War I. While the Ottoman Empire was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Russia was allied with Great Britain and France. Many Armenian volunteers fought for the Russian Army which angered the Turks who saw them as traitors and a threat. Once again there were massacres and mass deportations, an event which is known as the *Armenian Genocide*. A sensitive topic for many people. While most modern scholars mostly agree it was a genocide and up to 30 countries nowadays recognize it, modern Turkey still denies it. Nevertheless this changed the ethnic composition in the Caucasus region since most Armenians now left Turkey and also a reason for the worldwide Armenian diaspora.

The influx of Armenian refugees into the Caucasus was seen with distrust by the neighbouring Azeri people. The region of Nagorno-Karabakh became ethnically predominantly Armenian at that time and there were several massacres on both sides. The fight over this terriory but also the ethnic and religious differences and the jealousy of the Azeri because of the more wealthy Armenians led to growing antipathy. In the early 20's of the 20th century the Soviet Union amplified this conflict with the decision to give the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to the Azerbaijani SSR despite it being mostly populated by Armenians. Many scholars think the reason for that was to gain sympathy in Turkey, who was traditionally friendly to Azerbaijan, with the hope, the communistic world revolution might spread to Ankara and Istanbul. Nevertheless the conflict in this region stopped for a while, at least on the surface.

In the late 80's with the declining power of Moscow, tensions between Armenians and Azeri once again intensified. A few years later the Soviet Union was abolished and both Armenia and Azerbaijan became independent. Shortly after Armenian forces invaded Nagorno-Karabakh and conquered it. Immediately after that Nagorno-Karabakh became an [independent country called Artsakh](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Nagorno-Karabakh_Map2.png). While nearly every country in the world considers it de jure as part of Azerbaijan it is de facto a part of Armenia.

The unresolved status of this region is the main factor for the hostilities between Armenians and Azeri nowadays and sadly it is unlikely to change within the near future.

Interesting sidenote: The historical region of Azerbaijan in Northern Iran is up to this day [mostly inhabitated by Azeri](https://www.theapricity.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=40982&amp;d=1385762695). Actually there are about [15 million Azeri living in Iran](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Map_of_Azerbaijani-inhabited_regions_of_Iran%2C_according_to_a_poll_in_2010.png), more than in the Republic of Azerbaijan itself. But only a tiny minority wants a unification with  the northern part. Most feel satisfied with the Iranian rule and many important positions within the country are held by Azeri.

#[](#icon-news-big) Hopes and Overall Grades

###**Hopes/Predictions at the start of the season?**


- *Hoped for top half but expecting 13th*

- *Hoped for a top 10 finish and to avoid a drop off in the 2nd half of the season.*

- *Would've been delighted with 13th/14th tbh*
​



###**Season Grade + Review**

- **9/10** - *Best season we've had since being in the top flight meaning its easily the best Watford season I've been around to see. I made it 9 because I've been slightly disappointed in how we've fallen off in these last few games but at the end of the day I don't think it's at all something we can complain about after how well we've played. Even though we haven't had many results against the big teams going out and getting 6 points against the likes of Palaca was really important for us as that wasn't something we were doing in previous years even after getting big wins against tough sides.*

- **A** *Great season, one of the best I've had as a Watford fan if not the best. The only disappointment has been the lack of results against the top 6 clubs.*

- **A** *Based off of budget and personnel we probably shouldn't be competition with Wolves, Everton or Leicester tbh, yet we were there more most of the season*




​



###**Manager Grade + Review**

- **10/10** *Perhaps my opinion on Javi was slightly jaded by my pessimism towards our hope's at the start of the season. He has to be doing something oh so right in order to be achieving what we have with the players we have. He seems committed to the club which is a great wake up when you consider Marco and Walter previously*

- **A+** *To get 50 points and a  cup final with a squad like ours is the achievement of the season*

- **A** *Kept a big bloated squad happy and playing regularly through rotation, found a formation that gets the best ouf of our striker force which seemed impossible last season, relies a bit too much on Doucoure and Deeney (and Pereyra earlier this season) but who can blame him for relying on his best players? And just a genuine nice, uncontroversial bloke. not as technically sound as Silva was, but more versatile, adaptable and better at keeping the locker room happy.*

#[](#icon-ball-big) Best/Worst Match and Goal of the Season


###**Best Match of the Season:** [**Watford 3-2 Wolves (F.A. Cup Semifinal)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD-ciRFntwU)

 -  *Beating Wolves at Wembley. both the best game for a Watford fan, and probably the best game as a neutral.*

 2-0 down with eleven minutes to go, Watford's F.A. Cup final dream looked about done and dusted. Then Deulofeu scored a beauty in the 79' to get them within 1 and thanks to an injury time penalty by Captain Troy, Watford managed to force extra time and eventually won out with a second goal from Deulofeu.


###**Worst Match of the Season:** [**Watford 0-4 Bournemouth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnrR93FJrcI)

- *The 4-0 loss to Bournemouth was the worse result but we were down to 10 men for 65 minutes of it and Bournemouth were actually very good. The 0-0 draw away at Brighton was an utterly dire game of football which we deserved to lose by 2 or 3, but they couldn't shoot for shit.*

 Goes without saying the 6-0 loss to Man City in the F.A. Cup final also has to be mentioned, though these responses were given before the final so that didn't make the cut.

#[](#icon-trophy-big) Season Awards

-  [](#icon-star-big) **Goalkeeper of the Season:** [**Ben Foster**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/2932/player/overview)

 *Shout out to Gomes tho, undefeated in 90 mins during cup competition this season (this was written before the final). great sendoff for him.*

 Coming from relegated West Brom, one of the areas of need for the Hornets was keeper, and the 36 year old Premier League stalwart has brought some much needed class and experience to help out the backline. **Foster lead the league this season in sweeper clearances with 32**, with is 13 more than second place Neil Etheridge



- [](#icon-star-big) **Defender of the Season:** [**José Holebas**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/5713/player/overview)

 *Only Digne has been the better fullback from outside the top 6.*

 Gracia has had to trot out one of the cheapest, and oldest back fives in the league this season. With an average age of 32 and four of five being at least 30, Holebas has managed to have himself another decent season. Starting out the season on fire with 3 goals and 5 assists up until the year, the Greek's counting stats derailed a little bits since then, only registering one more assist since then. At 34, Holebas's aggresive style of play is still with him, seen by his 12 yellows and 1 red this season

 Honourable mention to **Craig Cathcart**, who ever since getting promoted with the Hornets from the championship has still managed to make himself the best CB at the club. This season even having his best goalscoring in the league with **3 goals** in 36 matches. Northern Irish fans will be hoping he can up keep up his form during qualifiers.


- [](#icon-star-big) **Midfielder of the Season:** [**Étienne Capoue**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/4843/player/overview)

 *Capoue has been our best performing midfielder*

 Coming in at the start of the season to Nathaniel Chalobah still recovering from injury, Watford's previous record signing take advantage of his opportunity and made that spot next to Doucoure his and never looked back. The long legged, industrious midfielder also has the elegance on the ball to be be able to be comfortable in possession. Both he and Doucoure also have enough athleticism to drive forward towards goal when needed, especially Doucoure.

 

- [](#icon-star-big) **Forward of the Season:** [**Gerard Deulofeu**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/4777/player/overview)

 Maybe a bit controverisal to some Watford fans as the Spaniard can be a bit hit-and-miss. Interesting to note that his ten goals in the prem came only against 4 sides: Huddersfield (3 goals), Cardiff (4 goals, including a hat trick at the CSS), West Ham (2 goals), and Man City (1 goal)

 Despite this, his trickery and adeptness with the ball always make him a threat on the counters or when in possession, whether it be with Gray or Deeney.

 Honourable mention to **Troy Deeney**: *We've lost 4 games to teams outside the top 6 this season, Deeney hasn't played 3 of them (the other one we were down to 10 men within 30 minutes). he's our most important attacker.*

 An undisputed Watford legend, Deeney's leadership, hold up play, work rate, and thunderous penalties have been vital to whatever success the club has had since returning to the Premier League. The Birmingham native managed to get himself a very solid **9 goals and 5 assists** in 32 matches in the league this season

- [](#icon-star-big) **Signing of the Season:** [**Ben Foster (£2.5 million)**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/2932/player/overview) and [**Gerard Deulofeu (£11.5 million)**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/4777/player/overview)

 *Foster has been great until the run in and more consistent over the season and probably better as a whole over this season. but Deulofeu is the reason we're in a cup final, so Deulofeu..*


- [](#icon-star-big) **U-23 Player of the Season:** [**Domingos Quina**](https://www.premierleague.com/players/19678/player/overview)

 *Pretty comfortably. Success has his good moments, just mixed in with a lot of bad*

 *Has been great when we've seen him with some quality goals.*

 A part of Benfica's, Chelsea's, and West Ham's youth academies, Quina was snatched up from the Hammers last summer and has since seemed to a be a smart forward thinking acquisition for Watford. Representing Portugal at the youth level, the 19 year old has a bright future ahead of him 


- [](#icon-down-big) **Disappointment of the Season:** [**Several**](https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed_tablet/public/2016/12/27/watford-mascot.jpg)

 **Doucoure** *hasn't been up to his usual high standards as much as I'd like. If you mean new players then I'd say* **Navarro** *because he's played all of about once I feel theres real quality there, Just needs some time to get the best out of him.*

 **Chalobah** *seemingly not recovering from his injury and hardly playing any part in this season. I worry about the boy.*

   **Kabasele** *was our best defender last season, but he's been a liability that has cost us games this season. Benched by fucking Mariappa.*

415,José Nasazzi – the story of the 1st world champion captain,"He was undoubtedly one of the most successful national football players, a true legend of Uruguay, of that land so small but so fertile with football champions. The 20s were also the years of José Nasazzi, during which the Uruguayan captain won, several times, everything that could be won. 


EL GRAN MARISCAL - Nasazzi was born on May 24, 1901 in Montevideo, from a Basque mother and an Italian father, the latter a native of the city of Esino Lario in the province of Lecco, and during his twenty years of career. He would never move from the capital of Uruguay. After the first kicks in Club Atlético Lito, he played with Bella Vista, a team with which he would play from 1922 to 1933 – where he stood out so much that in 1923 he was summoned for the first time in the national team for the South American Championship. With a powerful, tall and massive physique, Nasazzi could play as a fullback or central defender and his strength lied in his ability to fight and anticipate his opponents so much that he was an insuperable bulwark and worthy of the nickname the 'Grand Marshal' of defense. As it is written on the official website of the National Club of Montevideo, Nasazzi ""was the last to form a valid counterpart for this in Las Americas de los Adversarios"". In command of the defense Nasazzi led Bella Vista and Uruguay – and if it is true that in the championship with Bella Vista he never won the title, it is equally true that Nasazzi would take the most beautiful of satisfactions by dominating it for an entire decade. 


THE 20s OF NASAZZI - Yes, the 20s of South American football were certainly his and of Uruguay. With 'La Celeste' he put in a series of impressive victories, both in the continental field and in the world. As mentioned, Nasazzi made his debut in the National team in 1923 and immediately won the South American Championship played that year in Uruguay, but it was in 1924 that Uruguay became known throughout the world and Nasazzi won as captain in just a few months. In spring, Uruguay participated in the Olympic tournament in Paris and after a dramatic semi-final victory against the Netherlands they won the title by beating Switzerland in the final. In the fall, once again at home, he won his second South American Championship in a row. And it wouldn't be the last. Nasazzi won two other continental titles in 1926 and 1935 and in 1928 he won his second Olympic gold medal at the Amsterdam games by beating Argentina in the derby de la Plata after eliminating Italy in the semifinals. That final certified the supremacy of South American football, a final played twice over three days. After the 1-1 on June 10th, Uruguay and Argentina returned on June 13th at the Olympic stadium in Amsterdam, where first Figueroa and then Scarone presented the second Olympic laurel to Uruguay. 

THE FIRST WORLD CHAMPION - Uruguay is the leading team in world football and Nasazzi is its guide, its captain, its Mariscal. The 1928 Olympic final certified the absolute pre-eminence of South American football and the small Uruguay is ready in 1930 to host the first edition of the World Football Championship. Played in Montevideo in the second half of July 1930, the World Cup represents the peak of Nasazzi's career. As two years prior, the world final is disputed between Uruguay and Argentina and like two years before, it is Uruguay that wins the battle, with Nasazzi elected best player of the tournament and first player in history to raise the cup under the sky of Montevideo. With the National team, Nasazzi won everything. Now he only needed the national championship but to win it he knew well that he would have to leave Bella Vista and so in 1933 he made his pass to Nacional – with whom he had already taken part of in a tour in Europe in 1925 – where he finally wins the title he was missing and forms an insurmountable defensive dam with the Brazilian Domingos Da Guia, contributing to making 'La Máquina Blanca' immortal, a nickname that identifies that Nacional winner of the title in 1933. In 1938 Nasazzi retires from football, not before having won a national and a continental title after more than twenty years of success and more than 900 matches between the championship and the national team. He definitively hangs his shoes on the nail closing a legendary career, not before having played in 1937 a celebratory match against Bella Vista of which he was undoubtedly the best player in history and to whom the club nicknamed 'Los Papales' would later dedicate their stadium to him. 

English translation from [Italian](https://www.calciomercato.com/news/el-gran-mariscal-nasazzi-storia-del-primo-capitano-campione-del--92024) written by Alessandro Bassi.",soccer,1558708518,elrubiojefe,1,22,True,2019-05-24
423,What if players could only play for the league of their home nation?,"Just a thought experiment so don't take this to seriously, but what if? Of course due to the money it would never happen, but would be really interesting and entertaining. People are always complaining the game has lost touch with communities (especially in Britain), well if all guys on the pitch were English or Welsh, that would certainly re-establish the working class support for the game. I'd predict that the English (and probably Italian and Spanish) national team would be a notch above where they are now as well, with heaps of young English players getting the best training and coaching in all of world football.

Other effects would include

* A more global game (less focus on Europe in club soccer)
* Authentic clubs with authentic players and title wins that feel more earned
* A re-emergence of club football in South America (with Messi, Neymar, Aguero, Suarez etc. turning the Copa Libertadores into a spectacle perhaps greater than the Champions League)
* A FIFA Club World Cup that actually means something
* Money reducing in its impact on the sport at the highest level, as Man City, Barca or Real Madrid can't just pick off young guns from clubs who make an effort to develop young talent
* Players staying long term at clubs, as the only possible moves to make would be domestic

Some compromises would have to be made however. Merging of some smaller nations leagues would likely have to occur. Also I would probably wish for two centralised African leagues to form (one of central and southern africa and one in the northern desert Islamic areas), so that players like Sadio Mane or Aubameyang don't have to play in tiny leagues like Senegal's or Gabon's first division. Maybe small European leagues would have to be centralised (former Yugoslavian countries forming a single league, or joining other leagues).

&amp;#x200B;

Again players would never give up the cash and the top clubs in Europe would never cripple their ability to build a team by disallowing foreign players. But, in a idyllic world we can dream. Of Messi bagging 70 goals in a year for River Plate. Of De Bruyne crossing to Eden Hazard to win the Pro League for Genk. Of Cristiano Ronaldo lifting his 10th straight Portuguese league title. Of an all English F.A Cup Final, with English fans and English players, between two great English clubs (Man U vs Liverpool).

439,I'm a huge fan of collecting old football shirts and I need help.,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask for this but I can't think of any other subreddit. 

I would absolutely love to buy football shirts of already retired players like Beckham or Ronaldinho but I can't find them anywhere on the internet. All I can find is random shirts with their names on it and that's kinda infuriating lol.

Anyways if someone knows a website that sells authentic jerseys or something similar please, comment below. 

Man I would have a heart attack if I could get my hands on a David Beckham shirt from his short time at PSG or a Ronaldinho one in Flamengo. I have so many I would love to get like Henry in NY Redbulls. As I write this I get excited but well I should lower my expectations because I don't really think I'll get results. 

I would appreciate any help I can get. Reddit is honestly my last shot.",soccer,1558711266,underratedfellow,1,1,True,2019-05-24
