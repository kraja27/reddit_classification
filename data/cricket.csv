13,"In International Test Cricket, What Was The Best Batting Performance Of The Decade,2010-2019","Hey, guys IMO Brendon McCullum's 302 vs India was the best batting performance of the decade. And this is why...

One and only triple hundred that ever been scored by a Kiwi batsman, and what a time to score one.

India was well in control of the match. In the first innings, New Zealand scored only 192. In reply, India scored 438 in their first innings.

In the second innings, India again thrashing New Zealand in their home soil.

New Zealand were 5 down with only 98 in the scoreboard. India’s pace attack consists of Zaheer, Shami and Ishant were looking at their best.

Looked like it’s just a matter of time before India winning the match.

But not McCullum.

He came and started to bat and keeps on batting until he took the Kiwis to the safest place.

📷

When he finally got out he scored a mammoth 302 runs in 559 balls. 559 balls, can you imagine? What a heck of an innings it was. Wow!

I don’t know how many times a batsman has scored 300 in the third innings of a test match but it is probably one of the greatest knocks in the history of test cricket as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

So I want to hear you guys opinion on what you think was the greatest international test cricket knock of 2010-2019.",Cricket,1578950019,Equivalent-Winner,10,1,True,2020-01-13

22,ODI cricket in the 90s - what was different,"Currently watching the full replay of the 1996 Semi Final between WI and AUS in Mohali and have reached the 33rd over of the WI chase. Wanted to share some interesting observations about the turning points in the match, but also a few aspects of the gameplay and environment I found a bit different from today (and interesting). 

&amp;#x200B;

Disclosure: I'm an oldie who watched the original live game on TV ball by ball, as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Difference in fielding standards:** With the exception of Keith Arthurton and sometimes Lara, the WI fielding was pedestrian at best, but mainly in ground fielding and not so much in catching (which was alright). Routine misses on the bounce, not a single direct hit, Bevan and Law taking singles after hitting directly TO the fielder IN the ring. Ambrose fielding as if he's been asked to sit in for a different profession altogether. It was odd, to say the least. The Aussies were fielding the way most International sides field today. A great sliding save by Mcgrath at the boundary reminded of today's T20 standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- How important Ottis Gibson's fitness issue was:** The guy bowled 2 overs. He broke down at a time when WI could have easily closed AUS down completely, meaning they had to resort to part time spin for longer than they would have liked to.   It was also funny that the commentators were not making a bigger issue of this in their commentary (Richie, Tony, Shastri, Ian Chappel, Sunny - great combo of commentators btw)

&amp;#x200B;

**- How resourceful Mark Taylor was**: the guy had the balls to basically run about 17 overs of Waugh brothers + Bevan and Law. Its crazy how confident he was in using non-traditional bowlers. It ofcourse helped that the bats were not as explosive (none of the mishits reached anywhere unlike today - partly maybe due to difference in batter strength too) and the ball was the color of mud after the 20th over. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Steve Waugh bowling Lara was the other turning point**: Steve Waugh was definitely bowling to a plan. Chanderpaul was not able to lift the scoring rate so Lara was doing the heavy lifting. And the ball before he got out, he had cover driven Waugh. He got a bit carried away and opened himself up a bit in the next delivery and got squared up. If Lara had stayed 10 more overs, that game was done. 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Ian Chappell's weird comment on Shiv:** ""Shiv is a tiny man.. probably the reason he's not been able to make a 100 till now"". I was like.. WHAT did he just say?! It was said in all seriousness too! 

&amp;#x200B;

**- Praising BC Cooray for smiling after getting hit in the head**: Ump BC Cooray got hit at the back of his head off a Richie Richardson sweep. The shot was fairly robust and hit him fairly hard. How he managed to stay standing I wont know. But it gave me shivers. What followed was a replay of the hit that was repeated some 3-4 times over the next 2-3 overs, and Shastri/Richie (or was it Ian) kept praising Cooray for being 'brave' for getting back on his feet and not getting it checked with a Doctor (am sure no such concept existed back then). Shastri even tastefully repeated in the 4th / 5th such replay of the hit - 'Cooray got hit right in the coconut'.. it was cringeworthy, but I can understand why they were more casual about such things back then.",Cricket,1578965409,b4221,42,1,True,2020-01-13

You can etch out a name for yourself just by being extraordinary gritty. The most iconic example of that is Steven Waugh. Who was never that gifted, but ended up averaging fiddy at the twilight of his career by the sheer fact of his grit. A modern example is Steven Smith. Who is similarly lacking in gift, but make up for it in dogged grit. 

In white ball cricket, talent serves you better. Look at ODI prodigies like ADB, Kholi or Rohit Sharma. They are able to connect any ball with their bat and they can bash it around any place in the field. 

You can't teach that. This is the gift of white ball batting. To see truly gifted athletes, genetic starkillers, do their thing.",Cricket,1578980250,Bhai-Chod,31,1,True,2020-01-14

&gt;**Match of the week:**

1) Punjab vs Kerala - This was a match between a team sitting at the top of the table and a team at nearly the bottom of the table (Combined A &amp; B Group - No. 1 vs No. 17). A reasonable man would expect table toppers to win when opponent is also weakened in the absence of their strike bowler (Sandeep Warrier is selected for India A) but Punjab showed us why they should be added as a synonym of mediocre in dictionary. Punjab started the match well when they had Kerala 6 down at 89 even after Robin Uthappa's 48 but Salman Nizar (91*) had some other ideas and took his team to 227. In reply, Punjab was also struggling at 6 down for 99 when skipper Mandeep Singh's 71 took them close (218) to Kerala's total. Mohammed Nideesh, a guy who was playing just because Warrier is unavailable, took 7 wickets. Gurkeerat Singh Mann and Siddarth Kaul brought their team back in the game by bundling out Kerala for 136. Needing just 146 to win, Punjab had no answers for Jalaj Saxena's off spin as he took 7 wickets and Kerala won by 21 runs. Teams like Karnataka, Hyderabad and Delhi will be thanking Kerala for toppling strong Punjab team.

2) Haryana vs Odisha - Unlike the other match of the week, this match was expected to be a cracker. Top 2 teams of Group C were facing each other in bowling friendly pitch of Lahli, Rohtak. After electing to bat first, Haryana was skittled out for a low score of 90. Medium pacer Suryakant Pradhan was chief destroyer for Odisha. In reply, Odisha took all important lead of 70 runs with the help of Biplab Samantray's fifty (52) as Haryana spinner Tinu Kundu took his 2nd FC 5-fer. Haryana fared well in 2nd innings and scored 248 with the help of 40s by Shubham Rohilla, Ankit Kumar and Himanshu Rana. Suryakant Pradhan completed his 10-fer in the match with another 5-fer. Chasing the target of just 179, Odisha was in trouble at 79 for 5 but useful contribution from Rajesh Dhuper and Govind Poddar took them to 165 for 7. When Dhuper fell, Mohanty took them to 176 for 9 and No.11 Pappu Roy won the match for Odisha with a boundary. Ajit Chahal took 7 wickets in second innings but it was not enough to prevent a defeat for Haryana.




&gt;**Top Players of the week:**

1) R Sanjay Yadav (Meghalaya - 254*, 2/20 and 4/27)

2) Riyan Parag (Assam - 3/60, 3/82 and 60)

3) Suryakant Pradhan (Odisha - 6/36 and 5/86)

4) Paras Dogra (Puducherry - 194 out of 260 in first innings)

5) Cheteshwar Pujara (Saurashtra - 248)

6) Rahul Dalal (Arunachal Pradesh - 267 &amp; 33*)

145,Let's Keep Calm and Discuss,"We Indian fans have a tendency to be overly critical about our team. It's one loss against a better team (IMO) at the moment. There have been only three 10-wicket wins against India in the past 20 years, so let's take it as a bad day and move on. I do have a few concerns with the team structure and selection.

I feel Dhawan and KL should have been playing at a faster rate. Going 5 rpo in the 27 over with one down is not smart batting in this era. I thought India had learnt to be more aggressive after their accumulator-style of batting was found out against WI. I rate KL highly for T20, but have very little patience for 'giving him confidence' in other formats. The guy has been around since 2015 and still needs to be treated as a emerging player. Here's a radical idea - play him at #6 as a finisher. Raina was a top order batsman in domestic, but became one of India's greatest finishers in ODIs.

I am fine with Kohli at #4 on the assumption he will get back to #3 in tournaments. These one-off ODIs can be used to give opportunities to newcomers. But why does KL get chance after chance, and Pandey, who is in equally good form from domestic, not given a single game? I really feel for that guy because he can't play Ranji *and* can't get a game in international cricket. I am all for giving Iyer opportunities, but why not play him in place of KL or Jadhav?

The Pant question is a hard one, mainly because no other WK is knocking the door down. Does an avg of 26 warrant him a place after all these opportunities? Don't know what is up with Dhoni, but if management is interested in playing him in T20, the guy will need match practice (and we all know he won't go play domestic cricket). Not sure who India tries out in the A tours - I'd go for recent statistics over 'potential' that we just aren't seeing in the shorter format with Pant.

I hate to agree with Sanju, but Jadeja is a bits-and-pieces player in ODI. One or two, albeit great innings, cannot be an excuse for 20 mediocre ones. India has to go in 6 bowling options when playing him, and he is poor against batsman who take him on (eg: Eng in WC, WI last month). Which brings me to my next point - why not play Dube? Kohli must have realized by now how important Pandya is, so why not groom a replacement at such times? Rather see Dube get hit for 70 in 10 and get some game time if Kohli is so motivated to give opportunities to the next generation.

Is Shardul the best of the lot from domestic? His extra 10-15 runs at #8 cannot be reason enough to not play a better bowler. Bumbrah is coming back from injury, and Shami was rested, so they will get better. Probably good to play the more experienced Chahal in such situations.

India desperately needs to figure out a lineup with 6 bowling options and 6-7 batsman. ODI is India's weakest format at the moment - it used to be T20, but they have done well over the past few months to experiment and find their hitters and bowlers. I don't have confidence that India can get to a winning total even after 200/3 in 30 overs with Kohli and Sharma back in the hut.",Cricket,1579039057,justice-wargrave,16,1,True,2020-01-14

236,Why does Pant get Such a long rope?,"I think one of the biggest weaknesses of the Indian team is the number 5 role, aka what pant plays. While pant has done well in other formats (1st class cricket and the ipl), I don't think we should persist with him in ODI's. First, he gets out very cheaply playing stupid shots all the time, and this is reflected in his paltry average of 26.7, compared to KL Rahul and Iyer (around 43). Its even more concerning considering the fact that the Indian number 5 doesn't even have that much time to bat usually, and his average should be boosted like dhoni's and jadhav (Who averages 42 but hasn't played a game winning knock in a long time). Its also a myth that he scores well too, since his strike rate is the exact same as Iyer (103.7 and 103.6). The Indian lineup needs a versatile player at number 5, one that can save us from collapses and navigate a tricky chase, and pant can't do both of them. I think that either we have kl rahul play as wk at 4 and iyer/pandey at 5 or have vk 4 and iyer/pandey at 5. At 6 and 7, we should try 2 sloggers like dube+pandya if we need that firepower, but honestly if a chase is going well we can wait to send kl until later since he has a high sr (in t20's at least). Shivam dube needs opportunities as well, he's a batsman that can bowl and has a list a SR of 127 and he can solve balance issue. My lineup would be

1. Dhawan (accumalator)

2. Rohit (Hitter/accumalator)

3. VK (accumalator)

4. KL Rahul (Hitter)

5. Iyer (Firefighter (can save from a collapse and chase))

6. Dube (Slogger) 

7. Pandya (Slogger)

8. Bhuvi 

9. Bumrah

10. Kuldeep

11. Chahal

Reasons - selection blunder and weak bowling. Played 3 all rounders. Ravindra Jadeja, Kedar Jadhav and Shivam Dube. A bowler short and only Deepak Chahar bowled well. Mohammad Shami, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav sucked.    

Response - 2nd ODI against WI - series on the line in do or die match - made to bat first after losing the toss - Rohit and Rahul fire 🔥. We put a giant total of 387. Match over in first innings.    

3) 1st ODI against Australia - Rohit Rahul and Kohli fail. We put a total of 255. Australia chase it down easily with 10 wickets in hand.    


Reasons - selection blunder and weak bowling. Shami Kuldeep and Jadeja again common factor here. (same bowlers as WI 1st ODI)     

Response - I'm kicking myself right now for not buying tickets to Rajkot :p    

Conclusion - India has been consistently putting decent totals on the board even if top 3 don't fire. The main issue it defending low totals. Bowlers are totally clueless if we don't put opposition under pressure with runs. 170 (in T20), 287 and 255 are not really low totals. These are decent enough. I'd say our bowling strategy has been bad and we must learn from this. Your top 3 batsmen can't and won't fire in every match and your bowlers have to be skillful enough to get wickets even if batsmen are playing risk free. Also, coins have real grudge with Kohli.",Cricket,1579117164,MayurThakar,5,1,True,2020-01-15

289,"The All-Time Best ""Scored Centuries in Each Format"" XI","After hard work, thorough examination, and enough cones to sink the titanic, I've devised the best possible combination of players that have scored a century in each format. In total, there are 14 players to do so.

At this stage of this niche stat, it's more of a ""who do I leave out?"" type question, rather than a ""who do I include?"". Maybe as time goes on and more members are welcomed into this fantastic club, it will become more of a difficult task. I'm particularly excited for the women that may join this illustrious club.


Without further ado, The All-Time Best ""Scored Centuries in Each Format"" XI:


**Openers:** Both men have a triple in test cricket and are extremely succesful 

in all formats over long periods of time.


1) David Warner (44.43 average, 43 hundreds)


2) Chris Gayle (38.79, 42 hundreds)


**Middle order batsman:** Some real solid names here.


3) Rohit Sharma (44.14 average, 38 hundreds)


4) Mahela Jayawardene (39.15 average, 54 hundreds)


5) Faf Du Plessis (43.10 average, 22 hundreds)


6) *+Brendon McCullum (34.37 average, 19 hundreds; lots of catches and stumpings)


**Bowlers:** These are really just batsman who can bowl a bit, and are included in the squad almost entirely because of bowling skills.


7) Tillakaratne Dislhan (38.16 average, 39 hundreds;  44.16 bowl average, 154 wickets)


8) Shane Watson (36.74 bat aveage, 14 hundreds; 31.11 bowl average, 291

340,Comparing ODI players taking their eras into account,"Comparing players across eras in ODIs has become increasingly difficult. This is due to the massive change in aggregate statistics seen in the format over its near half a century of existence. 

We can see this pretty clearly in the aggregates. Below are two graphs for your considering:

 - [Batting Average (5 year running average)](https://i.imgur.com/01Vd07O.png)
 - [Strike Rates (5 year running average)](https://i.imgur.com/yRZbKwD.png)

This effect has been particularly extreme in terms of strike rate. This is not limited to just the T20 era. The steady climb has been ongoing through most of the history of the format. There have been some sudden jumps, but the overall trend is quite clear. 

The purpose of this post is, however, not to discuss why this is, but rather, how we can deal with it. To this end, this post will compare players by first determining 'era values' for the period over which their career spanned, then scaling their averages accordingly. To do this, the aggregate averages from the year of their debut to the year of their last match will be considered, with their own contributions removed. This removal of their statistics has minimal impact, but is worth considering. The choice of scaling value will be arbitrary, and solely for relative comparison of the players. 

This will be considered for three broad categories: batters, bowlers and allrounders. Each of these will be discussed prior to the 10 ten for year. No further discussion of the results will be given. 

#Batters

For batting, the obvious statistics to scale are batting average and strike rate. Both are crucial in the format as you both need to score many runs before being removed, as well as scoring quickly. A further metric, a batting rating of sorts, given as 'BatRat' below is merely the geometric mean of batting average and strike rate, and is there to help with comparisons. The top ten will be ranked by this, but this is merely being used as a consistent method of getting that top ten, rather than as an attempt at a universal rating for ODIs. 

The qualifications are 100 innings and 1000 ODI runs, and players will be scaled to a hypothetical era with an aggergate average of 30 and strike rate of 80. AdjAve and AdjSR are adjusted average and adjusted strike rate respectively.

#Bowlers

This follows the same logic as the batters, but uses bowling average instead. In terms of making a rating for the top 10, I've gone with the geometric mean of average and wickets per match. I had thought of doing it with fraction of allowed overs bowled instead, but this would bias against sides that bowled sides out more frequently. Average and wickets per match also capture the same information as strike rate and economy too. 

The qualifications here are 100 wickets, and the scaling is done to an aggregate average of 30 and WPM of 1.25.

When I try to bowl quicker through the air in the nets with my off spinner, it works, but in game, I end up bowling too short and get whacked, probably because I'd be using an old ball in the nets and a 20-over ball in game.

What do you guys do to bowl quicker? I've got a standard off spinners run-up, with a pivot and all that, so I don't think I can change my run up too much.",Cricket,1579164992,4ri002,8,1,True,2020-01-16

378,r/Cricket Census!,"  

Hello r/cricket!

I’m a masters student at the University of Huddersfield who is currently researching participatory culture. As part of our module we are investigating different platforms and how they allow people to participate in the media.

I chose to study r/cricket for two reasons. Firstly, I’ve probably read 80% of the content here over the last 3 years I’ve been active as it’s by far the sub I frequent the most. And secondly, I’ve always wondered about what kind of people are active in this sub and what their motivations are for using the sub.

The first part of the survey acts almost as a census for gauging things like age and country whilst the second part offers a chance to give opinions on topics regarding this sub.

Your submission will be anonymous and if the sub wants me to I will happily provide the results once I’ve collected the information together 

Thank you for reading this and I will be incredibly grateful for those who take part in this survey, though I understand if you wouldn’t like to.

391,Why do us Indians turn great cricketers into worshipped idols?,"Amidst all this talk of Dhoni not getting a BCCI contract, I've been thinking a lot about how us Indian fans tend to focus so much on great individuals (more than the team) and turn them into gods in our country. I read an article from Sanjay Manjrekar a few years ago, and that summarised it pretty well: [https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/\_/id/21462597/need-talk-our-icons-comes-selection](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/21462597/need-talk-our-icons-comes-selection)  


Because Indian fans are so passionate and literally worship cricketers, it comes in the way of the management and the selectors making rational decisions as well. Did you guys know that Ricky Ponting was dropped and at the time, the Chief Selector said ""in elite sport, there is no room for sentiment""? Compare that to how we treated Tendulkar in India, and how selectors couldn't even dream of dropping him despite his absolutely terrible last 2-3 years in international cricket. Heck, Sachin's last match was played from 14th-16th November 2013, and on the 14th when BCCI announced the retainer contracts for 2013-14, Tendulkar was given a fucking Grade A contract. That's the extent of it. Forget dropping a player who's woefully out of form; instead, we're handing him a Grade A contract even though he hasn't played well in 2+ years and is due to retire in a few days. As an Indian fan, I obviously have great admiration for Sachin and I don't think he's at fault for any of this (in fact, I'm not sure whether anybody is at fault). But I just can't handle how we in India tend to focus more on individuals than the team, and that eventually affects our performance. 

Even now we have these Dhoni, Kohli, and Rohit fan armies who're so toxic and attack each other. The Dhoni army begins trolling Pant whenever he gets out, chants Dhoni's name in the stadium if he makes a mistake, and doesn't let him settle in at all. These people aren't fans of Indian cricket, and I think even your hero MS Dhoni would hate the fact that you're blatantly disrespecting a player who wears the India jersey. If you think Pant should be dropped and hasn't performed well, say that, you have the freedom to express your opinions. But when you're effectively booing players of our team in the stadium and mercilessly harassing them personally, you aren't doing a service to Indian cricketer and I don't think you want the team to succeed. I really dislike 'fans' like this who're so clouded in their idol worship that they're willing to go to jeopardise the team's performances. 

I'm not blaming any of these legends of our game who've been great servants of the game. What I'm objecting to is the act of turning these legends into gods who're bigger than the team and can never be dropped or criticised. I'm blaming all of these toxic fans who claim to be supporters of Indian cricket but are willing to throw the team under the bus and boo our own players if their idol isn't chosen.

397,World Cup's most shocking moments,"Recently, I saw this video by the BBC where they list out the 50 most shocking moments of the football World Cup. It's a great video, even if it is from the British perspective, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in football.

I was wondering what a similar list for the cricket World Cup would look like? Here's some I can think of:

These have to be in the Top 10 at least:

1. 1999 Semi-Final. Aus vs. SA. Match ends in a tie after Lance Kluesner takes a risky single. Allan Donald....forgot to run? Australia advances to the final.
2. 1992 Semi-Final. Eng vs. SA. Pre-DL rain methodology changes South Africa's target from 22 from 13 to 21 from 1.
3. 2019 Final. Eng vs. NZ. Match ends in a tie after **that** overthrow. Super-over also ends in a tie.
4. 2007. Bob Woolmer's death and what followed.

And others, in no particular order:

1. 1996 Group B. SA vs. UAE. The UAE captain comes out to bat without a helmet........... against ALLAN DONALD.
2. 1975 Group A. Ind vs. Eng. Sunil Gavaskar scores 36 off 60 *overs*.
3. 1983 Group B. Ind vs. Zimbabwe. Kapil Dev comes in when India is 9/4 and scores 175 off 138 balls. And camera crews were on strike, so that innings can never be seen again.
4. Maybe the 1983 Final. India winning against the West Indies team seems like quite a shock for the time.
5. 2003. Kenya going all the way to the semi-finals.
6. 1996 Semi-Final. SL vs. Ind. Match awarded to SL after the crowd goes nuts.
7. 2007. India and Pakistan knocked out in the first round, while Bangladesh and Ireland advance.
8. 2011 Group B. Eng vs. Ireland. England loses after Kevin O'Brian scores a 50-ball century.

435,Most years of Test cricket since last batsman who averaged over 50,"Just as an aside, I thought it would be interesting to look at which Test side has gone the longest without having a 50+ average batsman. The conventions we'll follow are:

 - Only current average or average at retirement are considered. 
 - Players must have played at least 40 innings to be considered.
 - For nations without a player with an average of 50+, time since their first Test match will be used instead. 

If dealing with current players, time since last player prior will also be considered. 

With this out of the way, here are the results:

Team	|	Who	|	Date	|	Days
:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--
England	|	Barrington	|	30/07/1968	|	18798
Bangladesh	|	Never	|	10/11/2000	|	7007
Zimbabwe	|	Flower	|	19/11/2002	|	6268
West Indies	|	Chanderpaul	|	3/05/2015	|	1720
Sri Lanka	|	Sangakkara	|	24/08/2015	|	1607
Pakistan	|	Younis Khan	|	14/05/2017	|	978
South Africa	|	de Villiers	|	3/04/2018	|	654
Ireland	|	Never	|	11/05/2018	|	616

Australia	|	Smith	|	Current	|	0
India	|	Kohli	|	Current	|	0
New Zealand	|	Williamson	|	Current	|	0

For the three current teams, we can also consider their previous player with an average of 50+. For Australia, this was Hussey, which would give us 2567 days. For India, this was Tendulkar, which would give us 2253 days. For the Kiwis, they haven't had one prior to Williamson, and won't have one if he drops off.

* As mentioned in title, Sixers and Stars are 100% (or Unbeaten) when they lost the toss
* Teams really want the Heat to chase at the Gabba (3 out of 3). I know the Heat can muck up a chase easily but I know this season they've a 100% win record when they chase. Interesting.
* It's no surprise that the Stars love to chase given their batting lineup. They've elected to field just once which was at Ted Summerton Reserve. They won, so good decision.
* Ignoring the Renegades, Sixers are the worst performing team after winning the toss (1 win out of 4)
* From 4 games each, the Sixers always bat second and Strikers always bat first. So if they meet again in the final, you know who's batting first (given normal conditions)
* Heat are the unluckiest team for toss this year - only 2 toss wins. Yet, they're 3rd on the table. Impressive.
* Daniel Sams already has 4 ducks this season. Ben Cutting is second with 3. 
* Chris Jordan takes nearly atleast catch per match (9 in 10) while Sam Heazlett has 6 catches in 4 making it 1.5/match.

13,A Statistical Analysis to Determine Team and Player of the Decade,"I've seen a lot of opinion pieces lately, so I figured doing a pure stats dump as a team of the decade post would be appropriate. As part of this process players will be deemed to fill the following roles for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019:

 - 5 × Batsmen
 - 1 × Allrounder
 - 1 × Wicketkeeper batsman^†
 - 4 × Bowlers

These will be broken down further into the following:

####Batsmen 

 - 2 × Openers
 - 1 × Number 3
 - 2 × Middle Order Batter

####Bowlers

 - 1 × Spinner
 - 3 × Pace bowlers

As well as an additional role: 

 - 1\* × Captain (played as captain)

Why this mix? Well, personally this is the makeup of a team I'd pick if I were leading a team to facing a random side on a random group. That said, the intention is to present data in such a manner that if you wished to pick a team with a different makeup, you can do so in the comments section, to then be criticised for why you're wrong by someone else. 

As to the notes above:

\* A captain will be selected from the players selected, not as a specialist role. Data will be presented to help make an informed decision however. 
^† We're going for wicketkeeper batsman rather than a pure wicketkeeper, against my better judgement, because stats keeping for keepers has traditionally been utter garbage. Really, what I'll give you is the best keepers in terms of batting. This will crush my soul in many ways, but hey. 

In terms of how the best will be picked:

 - Batsmen will be in terms of batting average. 
 - Bowlers will be considering both wickets per match (WPM) and bowling average (ave) combined into one rating as a geometric mean (rat). This is done as the geometric mean of WPM and 1/average, giving a rating that is effectively wickets / sqrt(match × runs conceded).
 - Allrounders will be judged by a rating which is the geometric mean of the above two methods. 
 - Wicketkeepers, as noted, will just be picked on their batting. I will need to spend many hours seeking forgiveness for this crime, but you know...

As to why I've gone with that rating for bowlers? It servers two key purposes: 1, it doesn't disadvantage spinners as much (who tend to take more wickets per match, but have higher averages), 2, it values players who can carry the weight of their teams bowling efforts. I've had some people complain in the past that it would saturate, and some players would not be able to get high WPM figures due to teammates, but no team has ever averaged 20 wickets per match. Whether it's linear (ie the difference between 3 and 4 wickets per match is the same quality wise as 4 to 5) is up for debate, but for our purposes this should do. 

Anyhow, onto eligibility. In essence, we want players that have played a sufficient amount in the decade, and we want players representative of the decade. For this reason, we'll go with:

 - At least 40 innings for batting. 
 - At least 40 wickets for bowling.

Additionally, on being picked we can consider a range of different fractions of matches played. For arbitrary reasons, I'll go with 1/5, 2/5 and 3/5 of matches as the three possible ways of picking the lineup. For these, we'll calculate this from fraction of total available tests. This means that 3 possible lineups will be presented. Note, players under the 1/5 threshold will not be included on the lists given here. 

Now, this has a few advantages, one is that it doesn't advantage or disadvantage players for playing for certain countries. It also means that when considering the side, people can go back and re-evaluate what they deem important for the team of the decade. This also means that lineups won't be cherry picking criteria on a player by player basis to just get in the players I like, like so many selectors this decade. 

Additionally, z-scores will be given for each of the roles, ie how far from the average player in their sample they are. This is comparing players directly to the other eligible players in that role. These will be used to determine a player of the decade. For z-scores, however, number 3 and middle order batsmen will be merged, and players total runs will be considered for those considered there, while the sample their z-score will be calculated from will bat 1-7. The same goes for bowlers, but comparing to 1st to 5th bowlers. Note, these will be given within their roles, calculated from these rules. 

Anyhow, onto the lists. Note, these versions are truncated, but the full versions can be found in the comments.

####Captain

We have to consider which of the following players has been the best captain in order to pick a captain for this team. We'll list those available by Win/Loss ratio:

Player	|	Matches	|	W	|	L	|	D	|	W/L
:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--
Williamson	|	30	|	16	|	8	|	6	|	2.00
Smith	|	34	|	18	|	10	|	6	|	1.80
Cook	|	59	|	24	|	22	|	13	|	1.09
Sangakkara	|	7	|	1	|	1	|	5	|	1.00
Shakib	|	13	|	2	|	11	|	0	|	0.18

Hence, from those selected, Williamson and Cook shall be the captains depending on fraction of matches required. Smith is not eligible for captaincy until March next year, and I'll keep that in mind even for this list. 

####Final Lineups

We can then construct the final lineups, ordering players 4-11 by batting average, to get the final lineups:

Number | 1/5 | 2/5 | 3/5
:-- | :-- | :-- | :--
1 | Warner | Warner | Warner
2 | Cook\* | Cook\* | Cook
3 | Sangakkara | Sangakkara | Williamson\*
4 | Smith | Smith | Smith
5 | Chanderpaul | Chanderpaul | de Villiers
6 | Watling^† | Watling^† | Shakib
7 | Jadeja | Jadeja | Watling^†
8 | Ashwin | Ashwin | Ashwin
9 | Cummins | Steyn | Philander
10 | Steyn | Rabada | Steyn
11 | Rabada  | Anderson | Anderson

####Player of the Decade

Finally, we can use the z-scores to determine a top 10, and hence a best player of the decade. Only their best z-score will be given, as well as their role and fraction of matches played. 

Note, this will be a bit biased against openers, as they tend to average less than the rest of the batting order, but are being compared on the same terms. 

Rank	|	Player	|	Available	|	Matches	|	Fraction	|	Role	|	z-score
:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--

5	|	S Chanderpaul (WI)	|	83	|	41	|	49.4%	|	Batter	|	2.352
6	|	JH Kallis (SA)	|	90	|	33	|	36.7%	|	Batter	|	2.148
7	|	R Ashwin (INDIA)	|	107	|	70	|	65.4%	|	Allround	|	2.065

10	|	V Kohli (INDIA)	|	107	|	84	|	78.5%	|	Batter	|	1.743

Which would make our player of the decade Kumar Sangakkara, if we're going with 1/5 or 2/5 standards that is. Otherwise, it's Steve Smith.

Thoughts on changes you would make to the above? Who is the better side of the 00's or 10's? I'm personally leaving toward the 10's team. This list is based on performances in that specific decade, which is why Sangakarra is unlucky to miss out (his career is split between 00's and 10's). Also the team of the 20's is based on who will likely play for the majority of the decade, as Smith and Kohli are around 30, they will likely only play for another 5-6 years, not the whole decade.",Cricket,1577665375,allezjuel,31,1,True,2019-12-29

67,Most Underrated Players by Format,"Watching a bit of Kane Richardson last night got me thinking about all of the players around who may have a bit of a bad rep, or no rep at all that are actually pretty decent. 

In terms of active players for Australia I would say

Tests, Travis Head

There are lots of valid criticisms of him. His ability to waste a start by throwing his bat at it outside off is frustrating. At the end of the day though, he isn’t the technically flawed Mitch Marsh type that some people seem to think he is. An average of 40, leading the run scoring when we needed him in 2018 and a growing maturity at age 25 is a promising combination.

ODIs, Shaun Marsh

Shaun Marsh has become a living meme and a symbol of wasted potential in tests. His time in the green and gold is probably up. He is however a very decent middle order white ball bat. An average of over 40 and some great hitting power. Old Swampy knows how to hit it.

T20Is, Kane Richardson 

‘Is Kane Richardson really the third best bowler we have ?’ is probably his tagline at this point. He won’t swing it into the stumps at 150kph but with a 2019 t20i average of 18, strike rate of 16 and economy of 6.7 he’s been almost as good as Starc.

Though the guarantee is high, chance of winning that huge amount has become very difficult. Basically I play fantasy in most of the cricket matches, and i try to make 10–11 K profit every month. I use excel sheet and prepare more combinations and i make squad once the toss is done.

Earlier i used to lose few money because of me selecting my favorite players or going by gut feel. Then i decided to believe numbers and started playing fantasy only based on the numbers **(Like checking head to head stats, venue stats and current form)**

I worked with my fellow mates and they have designed an app, particularly to create teams and win money in Dream 11 contest. Initially i wanted to check this app, but found very useful in getting to know more information and stats about players.

They also give teams based on pure algorithm and it has helped me immensely in making money in D11 on consistent basis. People can believe their teams or else, they can use the stats to make their own team. Anyway it will be advantage for users who invest huge amount of money.

The logic which I follow is, I never try to make money in all the matches. I prefer to make profit by month. I win few matches and lose few matches, but i make sure to win certain amount of money every month.",Cricket,1577703326,Abishek_07,2,1,True,2019-12-30

111,The man who won the World Cup for a greater cause,"Apologies for the long post, but I wanted to share this story with you guys:

As everyone in r/cricket and every sports fan around the world knows, the world cup is the pinnacle of almost every sport in the world. Sometimes, the greatest generational players spend their whole careers never winning a world cup. Most players who have won it remember it as their greatest accomplishment in life. But today I'm going to tell you a story about a sportsman who lifted the cup not for becoming a world champion or for the glory of the country. Instead, he used it only as a stepping stone for something much greater. This is the story of Pakistan's Imran Khan.

Imran Khan was one of the best bowlers Pakistan has produced, undoubtedly their best captain and perhaps one of only two contenders for the best all rounders in the history of the sport. He peaked in 1982 and for 10 years was a superstar in Pakistan and around the world. He was rich and famous and he wasn't shy from showing it off. He had a reputation for being a playboy and liked to party around. However, his whole life changed around 1985 when his mother, Shaukat Khanum, died of cancer. 

Imran recalls that period as being a transformative period in his life. He saw what cancer did to people, their families, and their loved ones. He took his mother to hospitals around Pakistan and around the world. He saw her pain and he saw the pain of other patients around him. One thing he saw in one of the hospitals in Pakistan still sticks with him. Imran says he saw a poor looking old man walk up to the hospital staff where he was waiting for the doctor. The old man asked the nurse to confirm if he had bought all the medicine that the doctor had prescribed for him. The nurse looked at the paper and the bag of medicines and told the man that he was still missing one of the drugs. The man turned around and Imran saw the pain in his eyes that changed his life. Imran realised that he was privileged. He was rich, his family was rich and yet they were finding it so hard to get the proper medical treatment for his mother. So how were the poor majority of Pakistani people getting by? That was when he decided that he was going to build a cancer hospital in Pakistan that would treat patients for free. 

This decision was easy but he soon realised what he was dreaming of was next to impossible. Imran recalls that he met 20 cancer specialist doctors and shared with them his dream. Nineteen of those doctors told him that he could not build a cancer hospital in Pakistan. One of them said he could, but there was no way he could treat patients for free. Imran however, did not give up. He finally found some people who were somewhat optimistic in this endeavour. 

In 1987, after Pakistan's exit from the World cup, Imran retired from International cricket and decided to focus completely on building his cancer hospital. Pakistan's president appealed to Imran Khan to continue playing until the next world cup. Imran was still deliberating while his team were working numbers and feasibilities of building the hospital. They were adamant that whatever it took, this hospital was going to be built. However, the numbers were saying otherwise. A cancer hospital needs expensive equipment, staff, and medication. They realised that the fundraising challenge needed to build the hospital was like none they had ever heard of and they began to lose hope. However, one man gave Imran hope of making all of this a success. He said that they could raise the funds needed from the masses of the population. But for that, Imran would have to become something greater than he already was. He needed to become a name that everyone in Pakistan knew and everyone in Pakistan equated with success. He had to rise from the level of a superstar to the level of a national hero. He had to win the World Cup.



The world cup took place in 1992 and Pakistan did not have a good start. After the first 5 matches, Pakistan had won just one match against Zimbabwe and were facing elimination from the first round. That was when Imran Khan called a team meeting and told them that they were going to end up winning the World Cup. He said later how he could see on the faces of the players that they were laughing at him on the inside: “We are almost certainly eliminated and he is talking about winning the World Cup.” But that was what he told them. I am sure we are going to win this World Cup because I am destined to build a cancer hospital in Pakistan and the only way to do that is to win the World Cup. In the end, Pakistan just barely made it out of the first round and ended up lifting the trophy. Imran went to the final ceremony to lift the World Cup and he forgot to say all the things you are supposed to say when you win a trophy. He forgot to appreciate his players, or thank the people for their support. All he could talk about was how he was going to build a cancer hospital and needed the funds for it.



When he came back to Pakistan, he started his fundraising campaign. Thousands of people crowded around him wherever he went. Women gave him his jewellery and children competed with each other to become “Imran’s Tigers” by selling tickets to collect funds.



Yesterday, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center in Lahore completed 25 years of operation and treats 75% of its patients for free. Since then, Imran has built another hospital in Peshawar in 2015 and intends to build another in Karachi by next year.

The discussion covered Ahmer's identity as a Pakistani and a Pakistani fan, how he saw the rise and fall of Asif and experienced it at a personal level, his writing and how it reflects his own search for his identity. 

As well as this new phenomenon of Ex-Pak cricketers starting youtube channels that mostly pander to the Indian cricket fans.

172,Unsolicited advice from a nobody for The Black Caps going into the SCG Test.,"Latham: Channel Cooky. Shelve the drive, make them bowl to you. Occupy the crease, build left/right partnerships with the rest of the top four.

Blundell: As you were. 

KW: Plan A seems to be to come in and pressure the bowlers by scoring. Plan A is not working. Hunker down, bat time. First 30 balls played in the V or left alone, no exceptions.

Taylor: Ditto to KW. 

Nicholls: Been a touch unlucky, got a couple of very good balls very early on. But if you get a start, don’t throw it away. 

CDG: Bowling has been great, given natural limitations. Maybe bring the slips a step forward. Better shot selection required when batting. When you’ve just hit a boundary, for Pete’s sake block or leave the next one.

BJ: You’re overdue. One vintage BJ innings, please (just a Cowen with a kiwi accent, really).

Santner: Assuming you play, build on the batting foundation you laid in the last innings. Bowl flatter and faster to the top order, only float it up as a variation.

Southee: Good areas for longer with the new ball. Always going to be tough once this period is over, so get the new ball right. Batting has been disappointing. Support the established bat if there’s one there. If not, swing away.

Wags: As you were, you crazy, sexy beast.

Henry: Assuming you play, hit your lengths early and hope for a bit of luck. You’re certainly due some in this format. Remind us all how good a bat you can be, too.

Somerville: Assuming you play, copy Garry as much as possible. Give it a rip, toss it up. You’re 35, might as well have a proper dip.

Jamieson: Don’t know much about you, honestly. I know you’re about 7 foot 10, so bang it in I guess?",Cricket,1577754062,TheMinutePiece,29,1,True,2019-12-30

242,Random fact: Richie Benaud is the only Australian captain to have won a Test series in both England and India,"Note: I'm filtering by wins in India then seeing if they won an away Ashes or not, rather than the other way around, because it's easier. Also, it's sorted by most recent.

Adam Gilchrist/Ricky Ponting: Won in India in 2004, but couldn't win an away Ashes. Gilchrist never captained in England, and Ponting couldn't win in 2009, which was his last chance.

*Honorable mention* - Allan Border: He did win twice in England, in 1989, 4-0 (6), and 1993, 4-1 (6), but the most he could do in India was a 0-0 (3) in 1986 (this was the series that featured a tied match in Chennai). Since the trophy was last won by India prior to this series, he couldn't win it back.

Bill Lawry - Won in India in 1969 by a margin of 3-1 (5), but the most he could do in England was a series draw, 1-1 (5), in 1968. Since it was last won by Australia, he did manage to retain it. 

*Honorable mention* - Bob Simpson: Drew in India, 1-1 (3), and won in England, 1-0 (5), both in year 1964

**Richie Benaud: Won 2-1 (5) in India in 1959-60, then he won the Ashes, in England, in 1961 by a similar 2-1 (5) margin. He's the only Aussie captain to have done that.**

266,Crickets New Years Resolutions,"With the New Year finally getting under way I thought we should make a list of resolutions for each of the test nations

For example:
India - Gotta go fast. Historically to be a truly dominant team in cricket you need world class fast bowlers. India has the best pace attack in their history right now and needs to capitalize. My advice is to build depth and load manage.

New Zealand - Ties are lame anyway. Don't want to lose in a super over or from a boundary count back? Don't let it get to that stage. You also don't want to constantly lose the first test of a series and be forced to rely on your fight back credentials. It's time to shake the ""almost but not quite"" tag.

South Africa - A house divided. Unfortunately the biggest story for South African cricket this year has been off the field. With Smith and Boucher on board things are starting to look up but there's still a lot of healing left to take place between the board, coaching staff and players. South Africa it's a year for reconciliation and you're probably sick of hearing that.

England - Structural support. Great white ball results and the miracle of Headingly have over shadowed what was a miserable outing for England in tests in 2019. To turn it around this year stop collapsing for under 100 in an innings. Say it with me: Tim Murtagh can't hurt you anymore. 

Australia - Ok maybe we do care about T20s. You had a pretty good 2019 Australia, at least compared to the black hole that was 2018. But you also let someone else win the CWC. That's not like you. Time to redeem yourself by winning your first ever T20 world cup.

Sri Lanka - Do it for Mickey. Ok you couldn't beat Pakistan and provide everyone's favourite grumpy school teacher the memetastic revenge we all wanted. Hopefully Mickey Arthur can lead the much needed coaching revamp in Sri Lankan cricket. But you'll need to actually follow his advice. Or pull a Watson. Your choice.

Pakistan - Home sweet home. Cricket has returned to Pakistan and now we need to keep it there. In order to do that you need to not only be safe but appear safe. Boards will be guided by perception as much as anything when planning future tours. I'll settle for no less than 100% safe. Anything more is just gravy. Also justice for Kaneria.

West Indies - We will rise again. I imagine every West Indian player from the last 2 decades is sick of being compared to THAT team. But unfortunately I doubt it's ever going away. If you want to be dominant again you can start by not being easy beats. Become a potential banana peel for touring sides like you were to England and build on that. Oh and Holder &gt; Stokes.

Bangladesh - Embrace the new wave. Whether it be agreeing to a pink ball tour match in India or creating a T20 league to rival any outside the IPL Bangladesh has surprisingly been quick to adapt to changes in the cricketing landscape while other boards languish behind. Now it's time  to adapt that flexibility into on field results and finally force other cricketing nations to take you seriously. You know how you play at home? Like that but everywhere. Also if you overhear talk of spot fixing for the love of God report it.

Afghanistan - Please sir, may I have some more. Right now Afghanistan is a tier below the rest of the test nations (minus Zimbabwe and Ireland) but the good news is you'll only get better the more you play. The bad news is financial considerations mean you don't play much. So for 2020 it's your resolution to prove you can draw a crowd, provide a challenge and are worth playing for the other full member nations. 

Zimbabwe - Ever heard of Lazarus? Ok Zimbabwe cricket isn't quite dead but it is on life support. So get better. That's how it works right? Where's my ""thanks I'm cured""?

Ireland - Good craic. Remember when you bowled England out for 85 runs? And then lost by 143? I'm not sure if I should be angry with you for losing from that position. Or proud that you were ever in that position in the first place. Maybe I'm holding a team new to the test arena to unfairly high standards. Maybe high standards for 2020 are what you need to improve.

309,My hot take on the Brisbane Heat,"The issues with the Brisbane Heat so far boil down to their shocking batting order. Let me take you through all the top 7 batsmen we've played this season and we'll see if we can spot a theme developing here.

# 1. Tom Banton - 4/10

Runs: 87 | Average: 29.00

Had one great knock against the Stars in between a scatter of underwhelming scores. Glad we took the gloves off him after his poor first game as keeper. Really needs to pull his finger out and be more disciplined with his shot selection.

VERDICT: Can't really drop him can we

# 2. Max Bryant - 1/10

Runs: 24 | Average: 6.00

His dismissal against Agar is the final nail in the coffin. Poor bastard looks completely out of sorts and we really need to send him back to Brisbane grade to get some runs under his belt. Handy player who's good for a quickfire 30 when he's in-form, but he needs to start to think. He's a Gold Coast Titans junior and he certainly bats like one.

VERDICT: Give him a rest and chuck in Bryce Street

# 3. Chris Lynn - 5/10

Runs: 123 | Average: 30.75

Pretty disappointing show overall from the captain. His 94 was outstanding and I'll give him a pardon for the last game because he was on a hiding to nothing after being 6 down for not many. We really need him to stand up and he's only really done that once. Not really his fault everyone else around him resembles Chris Martin though. His captaincy's been fairly serviceable and his bowling rotations haven't raised any eyebrows so I give him a pass for that. Needs to be a better group leader though.

VERDICT: Keep him and pray to God he starts making runs

# 4. Matt Renshaw - 7/10

Runs: 126 | Average: 42.00

Only above average bloke in the entire top 6. Barring the last game, he's batted really smartly and according to the game situation. Getting a bit of purchase out of his nude nuts which is a bonus. We should really consider opening him and letting him play a Khawaja-type role at the top of the order because he often finds himself under far too much pressure to accelerate from ball one in the middle overs. Also means our top 3 is a bit more balanced and isn't stacked with sloggers.

VERDICT: Promote him to open

# 5. Sam Heazlett - 3/10

Runs: 38 | Average: 9.50

Probably time for this bloke to go find some runs elsewhere as well. Not really sure if BBL's quite his niche as much as it is for Bryant though, Sammy's much more of a one-day player, and it seems like he gets a bit impatient looking for quick runs. Extra points for being our only decent outfielder.

VERDICT: Last chance saloon. If he fails in the next two games give McSweeney a crack

# 6. Jimmy Peirson - 4/10

Runs: 34 | Average: 11.33

Keeping's been serviceable for the most part but his batting has let us down. While he's been called in to bat in difficult situations, he needs to stay calm when trying to rebuild an innings. 

VERDICT: Can't drop him when we don't have another specialist keeper in the squad (\*sad Lachlan Pfeffer noises\*)

# 7. Ben Cutting - 4/10

Runs: 50 | Average: 16.66

Not exactly a model of consistency with either the bat or ball. He's not really cutting it (ha) at this level anymore but unless we want 17 bouncers to bowled per over, Prestwidge isn't really threatening Ben's spot.

VERDICT: Keep him to reminisce on the good old days

# 8. Mark Steketee - 4/10

Runs: 15 | Average: 15.00   \[note these stats are only for the 1 game he played as a top 7 batsman\]

This man literally batted at 7 in a game. Lol. I'm honestly not even joking. I know this is a thread about batting, but perhaps for bowling purposes consider giving US legend Cameron Gannon a go?

VERDICT: Get him as far away from a cricket bat as humanly possible

&amp;#x200B;

In case you didn't notice, the theme developing is that the Heat's batting lineup is paper-thin, and highly dependent on Chris Lynn to score runs.

Here is my personal team for the next couple of games:

1. Tom Banton
2. Matt Renshaw
3. Chris Lynn (c)
4. Sam Heazlett (Joe Burns once returned from international duty)
5. Bryce Street
6. Jimmy Peirson (wk)
7. Ben Cutting
8. Cameron Gannon (James Pattinson once returned from international duty)
9. Josh Lalor (Mitch Swepson once returned from international duty)
10. Ben Laughlin
11. Zahir Khan

The bottom line is, we've just recruited really poorly over the last couple of seasons. We've let go Wildermuth, Neser and Stanlake, quality bowlers who have all gone on to play for Australia in limited overs formats; and our top order has relied on a mish-mash of inconsistent sloggers like Bryant, Lynn and Cutting and seldom available Test match players like Burns and Labuschagne. We've almost completely avoided domestic signings, as the only really prominent one was Pattinson, who is also a seldom available Test match player. 

There's no clear, easy solution to the Brisbane Heat problem. The club needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. It'll take some time. But it might also take just one AB De Villiers. We'll see.",Cricket,1577883246,StevenuranSmithusamy,20,1,True,2020-01-01

358,Four day tests? Really?,"Now New Zealand have joined support for four day tests with Australia and England. Four day tests. Four day tests. Doesn't seem right. People who really get test cricket understand that it's the closest a sport can come to life. And it is because just like in life even after you have had a bad day and don't feel like waking up and doing it all over again you are forced to do so. And before you know it the tide changes and you have a great day so you go back to sleep all happy and excited but you, just like in life, never know what tomorrow brings. The ebbs and flows of test cricket are nothing short of theater. A slow narrative boiling over four days and then it picks up pace end of day four and you are hooked to your screens, now it suddenly makes sense why they declared half an hour late on day two when you thought they had enough. You never have enough in test cricket. Time is such a vital component. But now it has gathered pace and heading to a dramatic finish on the fifth day.. well hang on. There's no fifth day. And the match ends in a draw. What if it rains on day one? Well then even before the toss both teams, their supporters and everyone know that's it's most likely to be a draw. Now how about that.
 As test cricket is so close to life and that's the highest compliment a sport can get, let's for the sake of fun just compare four day tests to life. 
Taking out a day from test cricket is like taking out 20% of it. I know, I know they have plans to bowl 98 overs every day for those four days, but who are we kidding? Teams barely bowl 90 overs with the extra half hour these days.
So if the average person lives say 60 years, and plans his life with the hope of living 60 years, there are exceptions of course but it is the norm to finish education by 22-23, get a job, get married by 26-27, have kids before 30. So your kids are settled or married by the time you get old or you retire. 
But wait. It's a four day test, right? You don't have 60 years anymore, you have only 48. 
Now that changes everything. If 48 is the new 60, that means 24 is the new 30. So you should have kids by the time you're 24. Hello all the 24 year olds out there!! Think you can handle a kid? Nah? Yeah, thought so. But you should at least be able to get married by, let me calculate.. umm 20-21. Wow. But to get married you should at least have a job or a steady source of income for two years at least. Which means you should start earning decent money from a stable job at the age of 18. Which means all of your education, graduation, post graduation should be finished by the time you're 17! Hmmm any 17 year old post grad Sheldon coopers out there? You guys are lucky. The rest of us. It's going to be a race against time. 
Test cricket would be no different when it's four days. Everything will have to be done at a faster pace because everyone wants a result right? So what was earlier the slow cooked biryani over five days would be a quickly made fried rice. Which is nice in its own way but test cricket isn't nice. Nice things don't survive 150 years, two world wars, natural disasters, every obstacle in its path despite a handful of countries playing! Sometimes I think the administrators don't realise that the greatest asset of test cricket or USP as many people call it is the time. It's the time it has. Time makes people do stupid things. Why do we see talented batsmen time and again rule limited overs cricket but struggle to be a good test cricketer. Because time. You have to think in test cricket. As there's so much time you have to plan your innings accordingly and suddenly they don't know whether to play or leave and they are in two minds. Not every 100 meter sprinter can complete a marathon. Test cricket is a marathon. Great limited overs captains have struggled to master test cricket. Why? Because test cricket doesn't have any power plays or set plays that you need to follow. No guidelines. It's a blank canvas. Every test is different. You want a deep point from the start go ahead. You want 4 slips and a gully for the first twenty overs no one's stopping you. 
Test cricket is life. It's a relationship to which you give and give and give and when it gives back it does so in such a magnificent fashion that all your senses come to life. And you remember test matches for decades. Headingley 2005. Kolkata 2001. You think those two tests would have panned out the way it did if they had been four day tests?

377,When and how did bi-lateral Limited overs and bi-lateral tests between countries become so out of synch?,"It’s crazy to me how these days it seems that teams are playing a test series in a country, then coming home, then returning 4, 5, 6 or even 12 months later to play out the outstanding limited overs series, nations always seem to be playing catch-up on their bi-laterals these days, whether it’s tests, T20’s, ODI’s, things rarely seem to happen together anymore and series always seem to get crammed in at the most confusing times (see West Indies recently playing an ODI series in India 12 months after their test tour, Australia playing a completely random T20 series in India in August ‘17, and now playing an ODI series in January in the middle of their own home summer, and many many more)

I remember growing up touring was a pretty simple formula, fly to country, play one day series, play test series, come home.

When did the calendar become such a mess? Was it the beginning of international T20’s? The birth of the IPL? The year that things got switched around to accommodate Australia’s World Cup in 2015?

Test Cricket is too sacred to be messed with bean counting punks looking to cut corners in the interests of  an inflated balance sheet.

The purity of Test Cricket has to be maintained at all costs.

When Don Bradman played cricket, It was white clothes, 5 days and unlimited short balls
When Viv Ricjards played crciekt, it was qhite clother, 5 days and unlimited short balls
When Virat Kohli plays, it id white clothes, 5 days and inlimited short balls.


In the adventure of Test cricket, time is a supporting character that plays an unspoken role.

Test cricket is an adventure where time is plays an unspoken role. It can be a foe or an ally.


The reason why Test Cricket has survived for over 100 years is because the fundamentals of the game have been preserved. 

There are other ways to revive the game not making it a 4 day affair.

475,Mohammad Yousuf's Golden 2006 run.,"2006. What a year for Mohammad Yousuf. I loved watching this guy bat, especially alongside the core of Inzy and YK. That calm presence, the high backlift and probably the only guy I can remember in the Pakistan team who used a Gray-Nicolls bat.

Making his debut in late 90s and retiring(or pushed out) around the 2010-2011 season he played:

288 ODI Matches 
9720 Runs
41.71 Average
75.10 S/R
15 Centuries
64 Half-centuries

90 Tests
7530 Runs
52.29 Average
52.39 S/R
Centuries 24
Half-centuries 33

In 2006 he breaks Viv Richards' 30 year old record of most test runs in a calendar. Viv made 1710 runs in 1976 averaging 90 and hitting 7 tons. Yousuf scored 1788 runs averaging 99 with 9 tons. To this day he still holds the record. 

Here is the list of tons he scored: I'll try adding a link for the highlights for each innings(if available) and scorecard.

Fair reflection of the top 5 when looking at this recent period of matches. Philander and Rabada the two most impressive in home conditions but somewhat ordinary by their standards when playing away. Holder brilliant at home and more than handy away especially from an all rounder. Wagner great consistency very economical away but significantly more of a wicket taking threat in home conditions . Cummins the benchmark has been a beast with virtually identical miserly figures playing home and away all while being relatively inexperienced in first class compared to the other 4.",Cricket,1578007106,The_Sexy_Camel,9,12,True,2020-01-02

I know considering the first innings it is unlikely, but it is not unheard of at all. They came in on the second day under lights with a brand new pink ball, with no warm up games. If they can bowl aus out( 4 more wickets) then we will be batting way before the lights come on which means when it does come to that twilight period, it is worn out and old. If raval and latham can last 10+ overs and take the shine of the ball then that would be ideal. Again with 3 bowlers, it's going to be difficult for aus. Nzs first innings was a warm up for them, they havent played in australia for 3 years and havent played a pink ball test in over a year so they should be more comfortable now.

43,A thought on DRS - take it away from the hands of players and empower the umpires instead.,"Long post disclaimer - also I don't pretend for this proposal to be better than current practices or even fully thought through, but wanted to share nevertheless in the spirit of getting reactions and feedback.

# TL'DR: DRS could be taken away from the hands of players and treated like standard 3rd-umpire referrals by on-field umps

**A: Is a Tennis-style Challenge approach (as it is today) better vs a Football-style VAR approach**
___

\- This is probably a proposal with loopholes, but I'll lay it out any way. Currently Cricket uses a Tennis-style 'challenge' approach where a decision can be challenged by the batsman / fielding captain and then goes up to the 3rd Ump. If overturned, the on-field umpire has to make this embarrassing signal with folded arms, accepting their mistake. Am I the only one who cringes on this?

\- However, Cricket is not like Tennis. In Tennis most line calls that get challenged are made by line umpires different from the chair umpire - so accountability is distributed a bit, and the game goes on without major interventions by the chair umpire (with a few exceptions) so the authority of the chair/line umpires is not that critical to maintaining flow in the game. But in Cricket, the on-field umpires are actively managing multiple facets of the game - ensuring tempers don't flair up between the sides, pushing the teams to get the overs done in time, making key out/not-out decisions

\- Of-course, one can argue that we could just move all decision making to the TV umpire since DRS is there. but as you can see DRS is unable to conclusively assess the line of the ball when it is near the stumps line: the margin of error is fairly wide even today. So the role of on-field umpires is key. And then there is the challenge of breaking flow in the game.

\- In some ways then (not too similar since Football is a fast free flowing sport while Cricket has natural breaks in flow), Cricket could be argued to be somewhat similar to Football where the Referee is central to managing the smooth management of the game. And Football's VAR system follows this philosophy where the TV 'umpire' is leveraged by the on-field Ref but the latter has the last word on it.

\- **As I write these words, I can already see that Cricket is naturally more inclined to Tennis-style challenges due to natural breaks in flow,** but I would still argue that it is damaging the authority and primacy of the on-field umpires through this charade of referrals and overturns (while rightly exposing poor quality umpiring at times - mind you not any worse than pre-DRS umpires but now under a brighter spotlight).

&amp;#x200B;

**B: So here's the proposal:**
___

    - Do away with player-led referrals and allow on-field umpires to refer at their level (for any kind of decisions - any kind of dismissal or even stuff like wide/no-ball)
    
    - At the same time, have a team sitting with the 3rd Umpire who can keep sending a VAR_style 'silent update' to the on-field umpires indicating 'this was okay' or 'hey this had some issues' and on-field umpires can take the call to ignore their suggestions or pick them up. 
    
    - Example 1: a wide got called in a tight-chase that probably shouldn't have been. The 3rd umpire mentions in the ear-piece to the on-field Umpire that this seemed wrong. The on-field umpire can then refer the ball or ignore the suggestion. 
    
    - Example 2: a close-LBW decision gets made and the umpire thinks about it before sending it upstairs with a soft signal of out. 
    
    - Example 3: an edge gets missed by the umpire and the fielding side is fuming with their appeal. The umpire does not think it is worth referring, but gets a 'whisper' in their ear-piece that boss this was an edge please check. The umpire then realizes their error and refer it formally to get the right decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

**C: Potential pitfalls of this approach**
___

**- Con #1: Time. draining:**  Ofcourse every LBW will go up - this will become a time draining exercise. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe some obvious decisions that get referred in desperation today will not be made and time will be saved. End of the day better decisions will likely get made?

**- Con #2: Umpires will not refer due to their egos:** Not sure if that will happen given neutral umpires and we are anyway proposing the silent update approach where the 3rd Umpire checks the on-field umpire if they see that the decision was likely wrong. But will have to test to be sure.

**- Con #3: Will require extra costs in the 3rd umpire room:** Yeah, and probably worth spending that money at the International level. Put a few analysts there and they will support the 3rd Ump ably.

&amp;#x200B;

Also - many times I feel the batsman doesn't really know whether an LB decision is right or not, and neither does their non-strike partner as they are standing at an angle. The fielding side too mainly relies on the bowler (who wants to refer everything) and the keeper (the most thankless job esp if the keeper is also the Captain) and I think we can just simplify all this and have the umpire decide what to refer vs not - **with the option of 'silent update pushes' from the 3rd Ump in case they do find a fault.**

&amp;#x200B;

**D: An idea to save some time - timer between overs**
___

Watching the curr NZ AUS game in Perth, I can see some of the change-overs between overs are pretty quick (45s) while others take longer. We could simply have a timer that goes on for, say, 45s - at the end of which if the bowler is not ready at their mark - make the next ball a free hit, and if the batter is not ready, then do 5 penalty runs or something.

79,LBW law talk on ABC Grandstand today,"So Jim Maxwell and another commentator were talking about whether allowing balls that pitch outside leg stump could/should be out LBW. That of course is not allowed currently. One argument was that bowlers would be more likely to bowl a leg-stump line, resulting in less attractive cricket. This has previously been the argument not to change the current law.

But- what if we allowed LBW even when the ball is intercepted outside the line of off stump? Currently you can be out just like that if you do not offer a shot. But, if you could be out like that when playing a shot, or be out if it pitches outside leg so long as it is intercepted in line with the stumps - would that i. Make the law simpler, and ii. still make it more tactically attractive to attack the off stump rather than the leg stump. Does that make sense? So that law would go along the lines of""... out if [the ball not being hit] and the ball is not outside the line of leg stump when intercepted...and would have hit the stumps if it wasn't intercepted...""

101,My ODI XI of the Decade,"Heya everyone! As the end of this decade looms, I have decided to compose XIs of ODIs, Tests and T20Is. This is the first XI, of ODIs. I would like to say that even though I have relied mainly on stats, some selections had my personal opinion on it, even though it might be negligible. So I request whoever is reading to consider that I have put effort into making these XIs, so when giving your opinion (which I would be happy to receive) please be respectful. Thanks a lot, and without further ado, here's my ODI XI of the decade!

1.Rohit Sharma: This was an obvious inclusion. Rohit Sharma was the second to highest run scorer this decade with just under 8000 runs at an average of 52.92. His famous 264 was rated by Wisden the best ODI innings of the decade and rightly so. It's safe to say that Rohit is the best opener of the decade; who would have known the move to make him open would end up being so effective?

2.Hashim Amla: Amla got in ahead of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Martin Guptill thanks to his superior runs, average and even strike rate. While he is known more for his Test career, he was a great ODI batsmen too. In fact, he is the only non-Indian batsman to cross 7000 runs this decade, which is a huge achievement especially considering the great batsmen who have been in this decade.

3.Virat Kohli: The easiest selection for this XI, Kohli has had a record breaking decade, going past a staggering 11,000 runs in this decade at an equally mind boggling average of 61.00. There is nobody who could compete with him for the no.3 position, despite them being the best batsmen of their respective teams. He is on track to become possible the best ODI batsman of all time.

4.Ross Taylor: Kane Williamson is part of the Fab 4, but a quick glance at Taylor's stats tell you that he equally deserves to be in there. Taylor has scored 6428 runs at an amazing average of 54.00, better than anybody who has scored more than 4000 barring Kohli. It is almost as if the no.4 batting position was made for Taylor, and vice versa.

5.AB de Villiers (c): Remember when I said that Kohli has no competition? That's only because de Villiers unexpectedly retired early. de Villiers scored 6485 runs with an otherworldly average of 64.20, which is better than even that of Kohli. He also made those runs at a relatively high strike rate of 109.76, which is rare for a player with so many runs. He will also be the captain of this XI.

6.MS Dhoni (wk): Dhoni may now only be a shadow of what he used to be, but that doesn't stop him from being included here. He is quite possible the best wicketkeeper of all time, stumping batsmen in a split second with lightning quick reflexes. And if that were not enough, he scored 5640 runs at an average of 50.35, so he can be counted on if things go wrong.

7. Shahid Afridi: One of the most unique players of all time. Afridi is the quintessential finisher who also is a useful fifth bowler. He slogs from ball one, so he can be relied on to try to amp up the run rate, though he could get out doing so. Although he has a bowling average of 34.48, he has a great economy of 4.65, which is important for a fifth bowler.

8.Mitchell Starc: Starc is the best left arm pacer of this decade, and that is proven by his sensational average of 20.99 and strike rate of 25.0. He was the top wicket taker of the last two World Cups and is a legend in the making. He's got everything you would want in a pacer: left handed, fiery pace,massive swing and accuracy. 

9. Morne Morkel: Morkel has actually been more impressive than Dale Steyn this decade in ODIs, and beats him and Trent Boult to this XI. He has taken 154 wickets at an average of 24.46 and strike rate of 29.5, which is exceptional compared to other top wicket takers this decade. He is seriously underrated and wholly deserves to be in this XI.

10. Lasith Malinga: The top wicket taker of this decade with a massive number of 248 wickets, Malinga was a must for this XI. He has taken them at an average of 28.74 and strike rate of 31.5, but he is especially known for those searing back to back yorkers. He also took a double hat trick this year, showing that he's still got it.

11. Saeed Ajmal: Ajmal may have fewer wickets than Imran Tahir and Shakib Al Hasan, but he got his 157 wickets at a stupendous average of 21.90 and strike rate of 30.9. His stats make him look less like a spinner and more like a great pacer. It is unfortunate he was not able to play as many matches as he should have, because he would have clearly become a legend.

6. Ben Stokes: The hero of England's World Cup final. He is one of the best all rounders currently, with 2682 runs a batting average of 40.63 and a useful fifth bowler. 2019 is definitely his year, as he played two legendary innings in great pressure, one to win England the World Cup and the other to win an Ashes match out of nowhere, so he is definitely a big match player.

He was the top wicket taker of the last two World Cups and is a legend in the making. He's got everything you would want in a pacer: left handed, fiery pace, massive swing and accuracy. 

9. Imran Tahir: The most successful leg spinner of this decade, with 173 wickets at a commendable average of 24.83, economy of 4.65 and strike rate of 32.0. Tahir has tons of experience and despite aging has remained a useful asset for South Africa throughout the entire decade. Only Shakib and Malinga have more wickets than him this decade, with generally worse stats.

10. Lasith Malinga: The top wicket taker of this decade with a massive number of 248 wickets, Malinga was a must for this XI. He has taken them at an average of 28.74 and strike rate of 31.5, but he is especially known for those searing back to back yorkers.

121,"Was wonderful to see Hope, Hetmyer and Pooran apply themselves today","I was very irritated by WI's performance in the world cup, and had expressed my annoyance at the same early this year in this thread:
 https://old.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/c0m4z2/prematch_commentators_need_to_stop_hyping_chris/

Today, I finally saw glimpses of maturity in the team (or is it a flash in the pan?, only time will tell). I saw all the key batsmen apply themselves to the situation. Hope showing that he can decelerate his strike rate and play anchor, Hetmyer postponing his tendency to hit everything out of the park by waiting for the right moment, and Pooran as always aesthetically pleasing, doing no more than required to safely cross the finish line. And all of them hit shots from the meat of the bat. It would be wonderful if they become a triad to match other triads like Kohli/Rahul/Sharma or Warner/Lasagna/Smith.    

I don't know what Pollard has been telling his team but I like it. They looked serious since the first T20 in India and showed they mean business. This is the WI I want to watch. Not one that runs around like headless chicken frittering away their talents. I want WI to become once again, the fearsome world-beaters they once were. All it takes is a little bit of discipline.

153,Why NZ shouldn't be disheartened with their defeat,"Firstly they literally had no preparation, they came from a flat, dry, low Hamilton wicket to a fast and bouncy pitch in Perth. They were given hardly any time to prepare with the pink ball, no practise games, only a couple of net sessions because they simply didn't have the time. The timezone difference would of been a factor for them, Australia have just come off playing with the pink ball so they are far better prepared. They came from cooler conditions and were then suddenly playing in 40 degree heat (47 in the ground apparantely). They also happened to lose the toss - a lot of games lately have been heavily influenced by the outcome of the toss (maybe letting away teams choose would be a better option - would they have won, probably not but I'd think they would of put up a greater fight). They were in the field for 2 days in that heat, that would of been extremely taxxing physically and mentally for players who were playing in way cooler conditions a couple weeks before. They lost the one guy in their team who could bowl 145+ on the first day so they were a bowler down from Day 1, Trent Boult (their premier bowler with an amazing record in pink ball tests) was injured. He is also a bowler that can bowl around 140. They usually bounce back in series after defeats (in Sri Lanka earlier this year for example) , hopefully they can turn things around in Melbourne.

Their bowling was actually pretty good for the most part in that heat but the batting was just terrible, KW played let's be honest - terrible shots in both innings, would of expected better from him but I know it's extremely tough. But I will give NZ's batting the benefit of the doubt this time given all these factors were stacked against them, however if they bat like this in Melbourne and Sydney then there is no excuses.",Cricket,1576452272,cantbebothered_tk,5,1,True,2019-12-15

I don’t want to give up swimming as I really feel it helps my bowling. So does anyone have a routine they follow during the season that they can share?

170,West indies cricket is showing sparks of brilliance.,"They drew with england earlier( with gayle at his best, so it was pretty much England vs gayle in that series), but their world cup wasnt as bad as people thought it was. They destroyed Pakistan, reduced south Africa to 29/2, almost pulled it off against New Zealand, restricted india to 263 and beat sri lanka. They beat bangladesh and have been competitive ever since the india series started. I know they are nowhere near as good as New Zealand got in that period under mccullum but I think pollard can atleast make them a competitive side. They have 3 batsmen in the middle order who can destroy any team on a good day, an accumulator in shai hope, and finishers in pollard and Russell. And they have a really good batch of fast bowlers. They just need to figure out what team they are gonna play in the world cup next year because some of the players will keep playing consistently but all of a sudden they'll have gayle and Russell and maybe narine at the world cup. They need to make sure that-
1.They use pollard's experience as a player who has played all over the world properly

2. I know this sub hates gayle but he seems like he is intrested in helping west indies cricket.

3. Make sure hetmyer/ pooran/ hope stay at the core of their batting and not dropped if they have a bad run.

4. Find a good spinner and hold onto him. I haven't seen much of hayden walsh jr so I'm not sure about that.

175,My Test XI of the Decade,"Heya everyone! As the end of this decade looms, I have decided to compose XIs of ODIs, Tests and T20Is. This is the second XI, of Tests. I would like to say that even though I have relied mainly on stats, some selections had my personal opinion on it, even though it might be negligible. So I request whoever is reading to consider that I have put effort into making these XIs, so when giving your opinion (which I would be happy to receive) please be respectful. Thanks a lot, and without further ado, here's my Test XI of the decade!


1. Alastair Cook: Only two openers shine when it comes to choosing the XI of the decade, and one is Cook, the top run scorer of the decade with 8818 runs at a healthy average of 46.41. He has been very useful for England, which is proven by seeing the number of innings he has played in this decade, a mammoth 201.


2. David Warner: Warner recently showed how good he was in Tests by a massive triple century against Pakistan. He has scored just over 7000 runs at an average of 48.33, at a relatively high strike rate of 73.20. These two openers also keep the right-left combination going, even though they are from rival teams.


3. Virat Kohli: The most prolific Indian Test batsman of this decade. Kohli has scored 7202 runs at an outstanding average of 54.97. Even though he is more accustomed to the no.4 position, I have placed him here because the one coming next has given a better claim to the no.4 position.


4. Steven Smith: Smith may have one of the oddest techniques I have ever seen, but somehow it works hugely to him. He has scored 7072 runs at a staggering average of 63.14, and in my opinion has been even better than Kohli in Tests. Australia may be getting flashes of Bradman, albeit there are significant differences.


5. AB de Villiers (c) (wk): de Villiers is the wicketkeeper for this, and he's also perfect for the no.5 position. He has scored 5059 runs at a great average of 57.48, and competes with Kumar Sangakkara for the best wicketkeeper batsman of the decade. He gets chosen over him because there is little competition to no.5, whereas no.3 has very tough competition which leaves Sangakkara out.


6. Ben Stokes: In the Ashes, Stokes played the Test innings of his life to win England a lost match. He has made 3738 runs at an average of 35.94 and has taken 137 wickets at an average of 33.45, which are great stats for an all rounder. He fits in the no.6 position perfectly well and can be counted on to make a useful innings.


7. Ravindra Jadeja: Jadeja has been great with the ball, taking 211 wickets at an average of 24.64 and has a miserly economy of 2.43. He goes through his overs notoriously swiftly, which also helps with keeping the over rate in check. He has also been a more than useful batsman, with 1844 runs at an average of 35.46, so he's perfect for the no.7 position and could also take the role of slogging a few before declaration.


8. Ravichandran Ashwin: The perfect person who can bowl with Jadeja in tandem. Ashwin has taken 362 wickets at an average of 25.36, which is commendable for a spinner. He also is a handy tailender, with 2385 runs at a decent average of 28.73. So if the team has collapsed and runs are needed, then Ashwin could be able to score some runs for the team.


9. Neil Wagner: Wagner takes the role of the left armed pacer in this side, and while his taking 194 wickets at an average of 26.78 is excellent, the main reason for his inclusion is his lion heart. He can bowl inhumanely long spells despite being a pacer, and that is a quality rarely seen. So that is why he makes it to my XI of the decade. 


10. Dale Steyn: Possibly the best bowler of this decade. Steyn has taken 267 wickets at an exceptional average of 22.29, and can demolish batting lineups with his magical bowling at lightning speeds. It was a no brainer to include this modern legend into this XI.


11. James Anderson: The top wicket taker of the decade. He has taken a massive 427 wickets at a great average of 24.19. He can swing the ball massively and is one of the Test bowlers for the ages. To take so many wickets at such a low average is a huge feat, and I hope to see him back in action soon.


Notable Exclusions:


Joe Root: He has a significantly lower average than those of Kohli and Smith.

Kumar Sangakkara: He may have an excellent average of 61.40, but he has too few runs to replace either Kohli or Smith.

Hashim Amla: Same as Root.

Kane Williamson: While he actually had a great average of 52.51 to go with the runs, he is still barely out. He is still one of my favourite players though and is the 12th man.

Cheteshwar Pujara: Same as Root.

Ross Taylor: Same as Root.

Younis Khan: Rather similar to Sangakkara.

Nathan Lyon: This was a tough one. On the face of it, he should easily be out with an average of 32.14 over Ashwin's 25.36, but let us not forget that he has made it as an Australian off spinner, which ruins his stats as he plays many home matches. I ended up choosing Ashwin because he can complement Jadeja better.

Rangana Herath: Great stats, but I could not replace Jadeja or Ashwin with him because I wished for right-left spinners and that the two also offer more with the bat.

Trent Boult: Slightly worse average than Wagner, and also could not bowl as long spells.

Mitchell Starc: While his average is more similar to Wagner, he also could not bowl as long spells.

Mitchell Johnson: Same as Boult, except a more noticeably worse average.

Morne Morkel: Has inferior stats compared to those of Anderson and Steyn.

Vernon Philander: While he does have an amazing average of 22.16, he just missed out on the XI. He however is deserving to get in, and if there were a squad of the decade, he would have been in.

Kagiso Rabada: Same as Philander, except with fewer wickets.

240,Twas the Night Before BBL - A BBL09 Season Preview,"Twas the night before BBL, when all through the r/cricket subreddit 

We are all beginning to dread it;

The birth of several new memes

Oh we all dare to dream;

I can’t be arsed to write any of this shit anymore.

# BBL IS BACK! I’M BACK! THE RENEGADES ARE BACK! YES!
I felt the need to do this in a way as somewhat of a sequel to my previous masterpiece [A Look Back at BBL08](https://old.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/ardl3v/a_look_back_at_bbl08/) (Please read/re-read it, it took a long time and its pretty good I reckon). I struggled to think of an idea for this post (other than the shit poem), so I dunno, lets do a cheeky little season preview thing that you would probably expect from one of these writeups (eventually). 
# BBL08 in Retrospect
Wait, that happened? Like *actually* happened? Hol up let me try and think about it for a second. The Renegades (or Gades as I will now refer them to as) not only won a grand final, but beat the Stars, and the Stars lost 7 FOR FUCKING 19??? Like what??? It was scarcely believable when I was ~~shitting~~ sitting in the ~~Etihad~~ Marvel^^TM Stadium Level 1 Grandstand on that fateful day in mid-February, with each and every wicket falling leading me closer and closer to that eventual orgasmic release I had when Dan Christian strolled in for the final ball and Adam Zampa slogged it I think and then *cum*. 

I may have gotten a bit carried away there aye. 

The magnitude of this glorious Gades victory never really sunk in until I came to write this piece where I could truly reflect upon how special that performance was (basically just me watching the BBL match highlights on youtube 29 times in the past two days). Not only did our bowling attack absolutely *illegal sexual activities* the Stars, but we somehow managed to comeback from 2 somewhat impossible in-which-I-asked-my-mate-when-we-should-leave positions, in **less than 48 hours**. I know Dan Christian may have carried us *a little bit* in both those games, but still. We fucken won. You can read a very in-depth review of that semi-final vs the Sixers (or Pink cunts as I love to refer them to as /u/wolverine-claws ) on that link at the start of the post (once again I highly recommend reading it; if you already did before when I told you, read it again, its better the second time^^probablynotijustwantmorekarma ).

Uhh where was I, oh yeah magnitude and shit. Since **the** final, my sports teams (and my general life) have been the epitome of success. Wait what does epitome mean? Oh shit yeah, it hasn’t been the epitome of success, and upon a cheeky check of the Microsoft word synonym thing my sports teams have been the *antithesis* of success. Ooh that word makes me sound smart. The mighty Melbourne Demons were one of the premiership favourites going into 2019, and ended up second last and winning just 5 games from 22. Tottenham went on an amazing run to the champions league final in June, before losing to Liverpool, and have since had their long-term coach sacked. Oh and yeah I had two different girls reject/ghost/eliminate me from their lives for no apparent reason so that’s fun I guess. And I did a year of uni so yayyyy. So an interesting 2019 anyway. What does all this whinging have to do with the BBL you ask? Nothing. I’m just venting on y’all :)

# BBL 09 Shit
So, as a rather interesting 2019 winds down to its final weeks, the BBL is about to start, *bitches*. If you wanted deep and insightful statistical analysis on the season ahead, this is definitely not the place to be. I’ll try my best to keep this short for both your and my sakes but knowing me this will end up being some 2800-word thesis on the fucking Big Bash like my earlier post ended up being. (Another reminder to read that post) Oh well here goes nothing. 

Note: To all fans of these teams don’t take my words as sacrosanct, I don’t really give a shit about any other teams than the Gades. :)

# Adelaide Illegals (pun on strikers but a bit offensive don’t yell at me)
From what I remembered about the strikers they had Travis Head and that Rashid Khan bloke who was like 19 but looked 39 or something and he absolutely carried them the last couple of years. I have no real idea who they signed (and no I am not doing any additional research on any of these teams to keep it fresh and authentic and as I well I can’t be arsed so that’s that). Come to think of it now they had that Ingram bloke from south Africa who was painfully mediocre from memory. (I now just realised upon re-reading this after writing it that ingram doesn’t play for them anymore, but I’ll leave it in anyway) 

Oh yeah and they signed Cam White, fresh out of the nursing home my 81-year-old grandma is living in Melbourne for some reason. Cam whites like 40 now isn’t he? Maybe he can be part of a dangerous combination with Jake Lehmann or something, who still has a BBL contract for some reason?? 

What I do know is that Adelaide didn’t make the finals last year so they… might this year? For all I know the Strikers could have signed Kohli and Rabada and they’ll win the whole thing this season. Lets say they’ll come 4th, and host * **The ELIMINATOR** * , the latest in the long line of successful BBL innovations^^TM. Alright who’s next, oh it’s the:
# West Coast Warm
I know the scorchers lost the infamous Renegades Dicking Duo^^TM of Shaun Marsh and Michael Klinger (see: Scorchers vs Gades in 2013, 14, 15 and many other occasions where they absolutely illegalled us through the years) to none other than the Gades themselves. “If you can’t beat them, join them” they say or in the Gades case, if you cant beat them, steal them and make one your coach and another a key player in your title defence. Doesn’t exactly roll of the tongue well does it? 

Only I could make a Perth Scorchers thing all about the renegades, um what do I know about the Scorchers? They’ll have Mitch Marsh available for the whole tournament, or until he goes god-like in the first few games and gets a sneaky ticket to India, before making a triumphant comeback to the Test team for the 7439th time for some fucking reason. Perth will also have the latest in a long line of meh English imports, which from now on shall be known as the **Tim Bresnan Club**. Welcome Chris Jordan (not bad actually) and Liam Livingstone (I don’t know who he is either). They got fawad ahmed as well, another Former Gade^^TM who is also from the same home as Cam White, specially wheeled out again for the big cricket tournament. 

The scorchers always seem to have some of that bullshit luck that makes them good all the time, and after an uncharacteristically bad year last year they’re probably due for another good year this year. Year year year. I reckon they’ll come 5th for that extra finals spot and god knows what bullshit they’ll be able to conjure up from the ghosts of Klinger, Marsh (past and present), Voges, Langer, Bresnan, Arafat, Willey, Hogg, Agar’s last ball six vs the Gades and that Livingston bloke who will probably be the next D’A’r’c’y short.

# Sydney Pink Cunts
Ha. Tom Currans my supercoach captain so lets hope he carries the Cunts to a solid 6th. Oh shit they got Smith??? And Garry??? Wait whatttttt they might be alright. Um maybe 3rd?? Nah 6th still. It’s literally in their name. Imagine having your team being named after a number lol. Remember the semi-final Pink Cunts? Yeah ahaahahah. Still love ya /u/wolverine-claws (its really late I’ve gone crazy)
# Hobart Canes
So Jofra’s gone I think and WHAT?? Gorgeous George is retiring?? Nooooooo!! Everyone’s favourite brimmed hat enthusiast and medium pace trundler is hanging up the gloves so it feels a bit wrong to talk shit about the cane train. Eh, its hard. They’re actually really good still, with d’ar’cy’s’ho’r’’t most likely to fuck shit up across the BBL once again. Unless he’s trumped by my new favourite player who you’ve never heard of, Liam Livingston, get hyped. The canes to finish at the very least 3rd, they’re still really really good. 

^^Oh ^^yeah ^^Clive ^^Rose
# ~~Canberra~~ Sydney Chunder
Arguably the most irrelevant team in the Big bash (if you say the Gades are irrelevant ill fkn illegal you) there isn’t much to say really other than they got Gades premiership hero Chris Tremain to carry them, Tight and Handy Offspin Club^^TM Icon Christiano Greenaldo and Ussie back again to lead the chunder to another underwhelming result most likely. Wait Fergo isn’t retired yet?? But Watto is?? Wow. Although Fergo did hit that big fuck off ton last year didn’t he so fair enough I suppose. The rest of the team is pretty meh so let’s just leave the Thunder at 7th and we can move on.

So with 3 teams left (Stars, Heat, Renegades) and the only spots left on my definitive 100% certain ladder being 1st, 8th and 2nd, who will it beee???????? *mysterious music*
# Melbourne sTaRs 
Ah the choking hazards are back again for another massive year of being sucked off by Warnie before inevitably making finals before inevitably losing in the semis or even, wait for it, the final (!!) Hahaha never gets old. Those cheeky green bastards thought they’d be smart and try and make some actually decent signings for once, with coulter nile and steyn along with established players Maxi, Handsome, Zampa and Big Stoin probably bound to do bits to them this season. At least the Champyun pissed off out of sheer embarrassment and shame that he caused to the stars franchise and that’s probably best for him. I was planning to do some over-the-top recap of the famous Choke^^TM in the final just to shove down the sTaRs’ throats, but they’d probably end up choking on that as well wouldn’t they (banter).

You lot reading this are probably thinking I’ll put the Stars last because I’m an annoying salty Renegades cunt who wants to watch the world burn and you are exactly incorrect because I’m putting them 1st. **The stars will win BBL 09.** You heard it here first. Why? Because I WANT TO WATCH THE WORLD BURN. 

# Brissy Warm
Following the departure of Bish Bro Brendan McCullum the heat thought they’d be all smart and shit and sign AB de fucken Villiers (for the last few games) as well as some random English bloke called Banter or something. (did someone say Liam Livingstone?) Chuck them alongside already established players such as Lynnsanity and Mujeeb, plus Laughlin and Renshaw and burns and patto and cutting and martin bryant and lamb shanks and they actually have a decent side lol. The heat will come 2nd and probably lose to the stars in the final but they’re pretty good. I don’t have many jokes about them because I actually kinda forgot about them (hence why they’re last on the list, minus the gades). So yeah lets move on.
# THE GADESSS
Well I was planning to do like a player-by-player run down thing, but I forgot about this until just before I posted so lets just run with a cheeky little preview thing. We signed shaun fkn marsh because of course why not, however we sacrificed Cam white but that’s not the worst trade off ill admit. We also lost Chris tremain which is a bit of a bummer, but signed some bloke called Gleeson, who will either be the greatest fast bowler for the gades since Harry gurney, or like a rimmington or something, I really don’t know. Unfortunately, we lost the Muffin Man but he was pretty shit so that’s alright I guess. Um what else, uhh we got the aforementioned klinger in as our coach which is alright. 

I also went to the gades family day FWIW, got my hat signed and shit which was some consolation for the several years of torture (and about a week of joy) that comes along in your renegades membership pack, which I have never bought because im a broke bitch. Shook Finchy’s hand, almost broke his shoulder as it was already weakened from the 8 seasons in which he has pretty much carried us, sans last years finals where he went out against the sixers from doing his best Kevin Pietersen impression with a switch hit (fortunately he didn’t follow KP’s suit and fuck off to south Africa the next season), before getting bullshitly run out in the final before absolutely cunting a Bunnings chair. And Dan Christian wasn’t fucking there which is bullshit because he was basically the only reason we won last year. Oh, and I went with my mate, who for long time readers is known as Emily’s boyfriend (read about that in detail in my last post) who was trying to avoid flexing on my sorry single fat arse that he spent a last week away on holiday at Philip Island with Emily basically fucking her for a week (he didn’t actually say that verbatim but it was implied, bastard). I may have gotten a bit side-tracked aye, what was this post about? Oh yeah preview and shit, go renegades btw if you haven’t realised im a full on nuffy for this team.

Following on from last years glorious success I expect us this season come 8th. Dead last. Wooden spoon. Whys that you ask? Well I don’t give a shit anymore. There is no possible way you can top last years premiership and the fact that I can say we actually won a real big bash premiership and im not actually dreaming or stuck in a 10 month coma freaks me the fuck out. The gades could never win a game again and fold in a month and I would not give a shit. As a bloke who has previously never had **any success whatsoever** in any sport with any team or even myself, well maybe I might count that long jump 1st place ribbon I won at my Year 12 athletics carnival last year through what I almost guaranteed was mistaken identity against me, but I am keeping that damn ribbon and am still displaying extremely proudly on my bedroom wall. I got sidetracked again for fucks sake.

What I am saying is that I now know what It feels like to have success in something, and I now have absolutely zero reason to complain about anything so I wont (well I probably will, lets wait till Thursday night to test that theory). We’re coming last, ‘stars’ will win. Who gives a shit anymore. GO GADESSSS

272,My preferred Australia ODI squad for the away India series,"This is a bit tricky to select because the series is happening around the same time as the later stages of Big Bash and given Australia has a history of resting and trying out players in ODI bilaterals.

Finch
Khawaja
D'arcy Short
Handscomb
Alex Carey
Ashton Turner
Mitch Marsh
Jhye Richardson
Zampa
Kane Richardson
Stanlake

7 of the 11 players in this composition featured in the India away ODI series we won earlier in the year so we have a solid core already.

I don't think Smith, Warner, Starc, Cummins and Hazlewood will play the series so that leaves an opening slot, number 3 slot and a second string bowling attack. Reports have come in that Maxwell and Stoinis are getting dropped so that leaves middle order slots.

Khawaja should be the opener because he was man of the series in the India away ODI series earlier this year.

I would like to try D'arcy Short as our number 3 batsman. He actually did decent in the away T20 India series earlier this year but was weird that he wasn't in the ODI squad as well. Also, I would like him to be a full replacement on Maxwell as our 6th bowling option. His left arm wrist spin in the ODI middle overs could be handy.

Reports are saying Labuschagne will make his ODI debut for the series but I wouldn't have him in the lineup right away. Currently, I prefer Handscomb as our number 4 batsman because he had a solid ODI series in India earlier in the year and is a good player of spin that can rotate strike well. Ashton Turner is our obvious replacement on Maxwell for the ""late order power hitting"" role and who could forget his stunning Mohali knock earlier this year against the likes of Bumrah, Kuldeep and Bhuvi? Mitch Marsh is the all rounder replacement of Stoinis. 

A middle order of Handscomb, Carey and Turner looks pretty freaking good because they all play spin decently in the ODI middle overs.  

I heard Zampa might be getting dropped for the India ODI series but I still would like to persist with him for a little longer. He also did decently in the India ODI series earlier in the year too. Fares alright against Kohli too in the shorter forms. 

Kane Richardson and Stanlake would be in the team because they are our possible bowling options for the T20 world cup next year. Kane Richardson also averages 22.57 in India too!

Yesterday, I was watching the BBL game. The ball slipped from the bowler's hand when he was bowling and landed on the practice matches to the right of the pitch.

The umpire called it a dead ball. Why is this not a wide ball? Umpires call balls going just a wisker down the leg side as a wide, but not this one? Clearly the bowler made a bigger mistake here than bowling it a little in the leg side?
 
Also, when can a batsmen decide to walk and hit such a ball to score runs. I have seen in other matches batsmen scoring runs off those balls. Why did the umpire not call it a dead ball in that case?",Cricket,1576641296,rajuvamsi007,11,1,True,2019-12-17

1,"Due to his low games-played, and obvious godlike talent, Marny Lasagna has a real shot at breaking the fabled 100 avg.","This is actually sorta legit. so long as you like to dream a little..

So I'm looking at his numbers and I'm being quite liberal with my rounding but the results are pretty close. 

Innings played = 16

Avg about 50

&amp;#x200B;

So he scored about 800 runs over those innings. To ""catch up"" to making 100 average he essentially owes 800 runs on top of maintaining 100 average. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with breaking this particular record is that most batsmen have a substantial amount of games under their belt before they reach a peak where they can actually maintain a 100+ average. The amount of runs they need to ""catch up"" could be 5000+. It would take years of consistently scoring ludicrous amounts (think 3 years scoring a double ton every innings). Even Steven Smith, god's own cricket bat, owes about 4500 runs.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, re-gaining 800 runs while having to get 100+ is pretty crazy, but i'm sure there is precedent. What I'm getting at is there's a slim but real chance we see that record go - and not from some one-off stat fluke like some players have played one innings and scored a century.   


For more weight to the argument - I think innings not out is like adding a score to next innings in regards to totals calculation? So a very real scenario is he hits the double ton mark tomorrow and australia declares. Boom suddenly that 800 runs drops to 600 with maybe another innings against this unenthusiastic pakistani attack still to come.",Cricket,1575051790,cleenmeenpeen,20,1,True,2019-11-29
2,The curious case of Muhammad Abbas: Why is he ineffective? Or is Pakistani Team Management simply retarded?,"Hello. Apologies for the wall of text.

I have been following Abbas since his tour to England. I remember how he dismissed English batsmen for cheap in first innings, which played major role in Pakistan's only test win. 

But what is curious, how englishmen adapted to the conditions. During 2nd innings, they started taking guard outside the crease with the exception of one or two batsmen. Lo and behold. They immediately looked totally different batsmen batting against the most ordinary bowler the world may have produced. And the result of 2nd match proved to be different as well, as they owned Abbas in that match, leveling the series 1-1.

So, how did Pakistan counter that? Well, they couldn't. Sarfraz, the fitness champion he was, and captain at the time, didn't even bother standing close to stumps as he was downright incompetent to collect balls travelling at that pace. That reminded me of Gilchrist, how he used to stand right up to stumps for Aussie Medium Pacer: Ian Harvey. The nip and slight swing were enough to catch the batsmen in the crease while he bowled wicket to wicket. 

Fast forward to South Africa tour, and Abbas failed again. And everyone questioned him for the lack of pace. That's when we first started to hear about his shoulder injury. Seems convenient. No one even suggested how keeper should suck it up and at least try to do his job for a change. Because standing close to stumps would require fitness of Sarfraz and more effort on his part. 

Eventually, Abbas was left out of the ODI squads citing the same shoulder injuries when Amir was available. Had the medium pacer played ODIs and bowled his quota of 10 overs, with nip and seam he gets off the new ball, and keeper standing close to stumps, the results might have been drastic for the opposition in the world cup. Reason? Because, Abbas is crafty with the ball. He works the batsman by bowling over and over again, in the same area and rely on slight variations of seam movement on deck, as his real weapon. That's what earned him huge victory in the start of his career in UAE. The dead track where the only the likes of McGrath succeeded for the same reason. 

But McGrath used to bowl in mid-high 130s, fast enough that I almost never saw any batsman standing outside his crease to him. Also, partly because of his height. The well directed bouncer to batsman advancing was too much of risk to take. But Abbas doesn't have height to work with. The speed is also 10-15% slower than McGrath. So, he doesn't have the luxury to counter this on his own. 

Now, problem is Amir isn't playing. Other bowlers are old and probably done playing test cricket as well. Now, team management/ PCB resorted to Abbas for wickets with new ball. But they clearly don't know what's wrong with him. They cite his injury as a reason for not able to pick wickets, or his lack of pace. No one, made serious efforts in working the keeper for him. That suggests PCB &amp; team management is full of retards. They have zero adaptability to change in conditions/factors affecting team performance. 

Which begs the question, what is even coach doing? As usual they will hide behind young &amp; inexperience team, when this tactic could have easily been implemented along with others. The team management, including the bowling coach, only picks basic things up when it's being discussed in commentary box during match. WTF. They are supposed to do this in training. They don't even check batsmen for weakness, as evident from Warner in 1st match. If coach had worked his bowlers up for the plan to dismiss Warner like Broad and thought Bowlers forgot about it, he could have relayed the message in drink breaks. But No. The PCB &amp; team management is full of liars &amp; retards. They didn't even work on it, and it was only in 2nd day that Warner was dismissed with same weakness Broad exploited.

I hope Australia stops taking Pakistan's visits to visit their country, unless something drastic changes with the attitude of Pakistanis regarding how seriously they take cricket. Passion for retarded, incompetent &amp; clueless cricket, explains why Afridi played 400+ ODIs with inconsistent performance.

I can bet my life on it that Abbas will be a totally changed bowler if a decent keeper can stand right up to the stumps. Otherwise, his career is over.",Cricket,1575052294,YahodiSazish,28,1,True,2019-11-29

The BCCI President Sourav Ganguly on Friday said that there's enough time to decide on Mahendra Singh Dhoni's future and things will get clearer in a few months time.

 At an event in Mumbai on Wednesday, Dhoni had said questions regarding his return to cricket should only be asked after January 2020.

But Ganguly said there was ""absolute clarity"" among the team think-tank on how to deal with Dhoni's future.

""No no, there is clarity, but certain things cannot be said on public platform. There is absolute clarity on MS Dhoni and you'll find out in time,"" Ganguly said on the sidelines of a felicitation ceremony organised by Ajanta Shoes.

78,Rant from a Pakistan Fan,"The performance of this squad since Misbah has been chief selector and Coach has been pitiful. I have never seen a top 8 team this pathetic. Under no circumstances should a batsmen be permitted by the bowling to score 300 off of 389 in a fucking test. 

After Smithy’s wicket, Wade came in and scored 21 off of 20 at the time of writing. Labuschagne has scored back to back 150s. Yasir has damn near gone for 200. What is Misbah doing allowing Yasir to even touch the ball in Australia where he’s historically been shit? Why pull Naseem when he bowled decently and replace him with Musa who’s FC record isn’t impressive. 

If we Bat first then Babar’s back breaks trying to carry us to 260. If we bowl first this happens.

An international squad should not be this pathetic against anyone in any conditions. Selection and coaching is so bad that we lose before the coin is tossed. 

Azhar’s captaincy seemed like a panic decision and he has proven he can’t set a field to save his life. Fielding is atrocious, top order collapses and is barely saved by Shafiq, Babar and Rizwan are our only batsmen. Yasir is more reliable than someone like Haris or Ifikthar. This whole issue could’ve been resolved years ago with the inclusion of Fawad Alam.

The PCB is broken and Misbah needs to be let go immediately.

I'm a relatively new cricket fan, the only cricket I watched before this year was Ashes 05/09 when I would've been 4 and 8 respectively. (test cricket is my favourite btw). 

So I was wondering, why do some people think the captaincy has had more of an effect on his form than the team's structure?

What I mean by that is the batting order and the quality of batsmen above Root. I totally understand that the captaincy has had some effect, but surely him batting further up and with batsmen who just aren't as good as earlier ones (Cook etc.) has hurt him more?

Let's take the Ashes as an example. If he's at 3, batting behind Burns and Roy/Denly, if Roy goes for like 8, all of a sudden Root is basically opening the batting. Yesterday, Sibley and Denly went for a total of 8, although he's at 4 now, that's just not a comforting buffer. When Cook played (I apologise for not knowing the others), Root could go to the crease and grind tired bowlers into dust, after they'd been worn down by solid openers. 

Anyway, it'd be cool to get some veteran views on this, I've read about both factors, but most discussion seems to centralise the captaincy.",Cricket,1575142608,HoneyBadgerXI,2,1,True,2019-11-30

169,Pakistan Vs Sri Lanka - 1st Test Predictions,"As a Pakistan fan, I’m just gonna forget this Australia tour and move on to the future: Test Cricket returns to Pakistan after more than 10 years! Personally I believe Pakistan might (and I say might because we are very unpredictable) win the series 2-0. If anyone wants to suggest a Sri Lanka Xi, please do so however here is my Pakistan 1st Test Xi:

1) Abid Ali
2) Shan Masood
3) Fawad Alam/Haris Sohail
4) Azhar Ali
5) Babar Azam
6) Asad Shafiq
7) Sarfaraz Ahmed (C)(WK)
8) Yasir Shah
9) Shaheen Shah Afridi
10) Naseem Shah
11) Mohammad Abbas

Abid Ali comes in for Imam Ul-Haq because he must be given chances to play and his record so far in Asia is pretty good. Fawad Alam needs to play now in place of the underperforming Haris Sohail. Haris could get chosen on the basis of his decent Asia record. Sarfaraz comes back in for Rizwan. Yes Rizwan is good and potentially better than Sarfaraz but what we need now is a Captain more than batsman. Sarfaraz has been playing well in first-class matches recently and deserves to be judged on his red ball performances rather than white ball. Our bowling attack remains the same however Naseem Shah along with the other bowlers must be given time to mature, especially the younger ones. Yasir needs to get his line and length correct and Abbas has a great record in Asia making the bowl swing where the pitches are almost dead. I’m backing him to recover well enough and regain some pace by then. Apart from that, I would have Imam on the bench alongside Musa, Haris, Rizwan and Iftikhar.

268,Fawad Alam is overrated.,"Hear me out. 

- He has 12000 runs in FC cricket. This is puny compared to Jack Hobbs’ 61000. When he isn’t even in the top 10 run scorers in FC Cricket, why pick him?

- He has scored 0 test runs  this decade. This is pathetic. How can one go ten years without scoring a run? He should learn from Yasir “Lionel “Steve Smith” Messi” Shah, who recently hit a hundred in Australia. 

- He has 0 test wickets. How can Pakistan even think of picking a player who is a leggie that can bat a bit? He rates 0 on the SPDmeter. Maybe pick up Umar Akmal instead. 

- His strike rate is too low. He strikes at 56 in tests. This is virgin material. Compare this to Pakistan’s GOAT batsman, Shahid “he’s only 16” Afridi, who strikes at a *chad* 87 in tests. That’s 31 runs Fawad misses out on for every 100 balls faced. Missed opportunities. 

- He’s 34, and has an average of 56.57. What a poor average for his age. Take someone like Bahir Shah, another young lad from Afghanistan. He averages 71.16 in FC cricket, and is only 19 years old! From this, we can conclude that for Fawad to be anywhere near selection, he should average **127.34**. So he falls well below par.",Cricket,1575197811,marnuslabuschagne,50,1,True,2019-12-01

**Azhar Ali | Pakistan skipper:** ""I'd like to congratulate Australia, they played wonderful cricket, especially David Warner for his triple hundred. It's always hard coming to Australia, we've been beaten by a better side. We lacked in all three departments in both Tests but we take some positives and learnings. If you don't bowl good and line they always score quickly and you have to field well. When you get in, score big and make big partnerships. We said we didn't want to give up at any stage. Yasir put up a lot of fight. Babar has been exceptional in this series, that's a great positive. It's very hard here with a young bowling attack, we came with a lot of expectations but it didn't go well. Very positive for the future, we will learn a lot.""

**David Warner | Player of the Match and Series:** ""I'm very happy we didn't have to bat again. I was very tired last night, fell asleep on the couch. Great team performance, to win two in a row by an innings. For us, it's a memory and reflect of our mates' life - it was on his birthday as well - difficult time for the guys. Adelaide is a nice batting track, back yourself. Enjoying it even more and hungrier than ever. We'll be coming up against quality opposition in New Zealand, we know every time they come across it's a good contest.""

**Tim Paine | Australia skipper:** Tim Paine ""Really happy, probably barring a few slips in the field. Played some fantastic cricket. Really pleasing to get the results to start the summer. What we wanted from our batters was big runs. Our batters, David and Marnus, have been unbelievably good. Guys are stepping up, that's what good sides do. [Warner] We witnessed something really special. Unbelievable innings, top one or two from an Australian of all time. [Warner getting 400?] We didn't debate it, spoke about it that we had a time to declare. Davey was all for it, we are here to win Test matches and climb rankings. Wanted to make sure we had time to win the game. Never came into the calculations. [Starc] Think he's okay, just a big toe thing which he has to warm up. Thought our bowlers were huge, difficult wicket for bowlers unless the lights are on. Awesome effort, they kept coming. Best spinner in the world stood up today, though Lyno was awesome. I'd like to hold a few more catches, the challenge of the pink ball Test can be fielding. It is very different. We need to get better at that with Perth in a week's time. The next three Tests will be really competitive.""

399,No-ball reviews,"So if you get a wicket and the umpires opt to check the front foot, and you’re over. The delivery is considered illegitimate and the wicket it overturned. However, you as a bowler may feel as if the umpire should’ve told you before so you could get that foot back behind the line. 

If the no-ball is called live you move your foot back the next delivery. However, what if the umpire is wrong and you didn’t overstep? What if this was a wicket delivery, called on field as a no-ball?

A solution is perhaps having two different sets of reviews for bowling teams, the regular two reviews that the team currently has but an extra 2-3 separate reviews exclusively for no balls. Umpires would rather not call no balls and have it overturned, than call a no ball and be wrong. This would allow umpires to police the no ball easier and not fear getting it wrong. 

If the bowler or fielders close in don’t believe it’s a no ball they can quickly send it upstairs. These reviews would also function more strictly as to not waste time. Umpires call would rarely, if ever come into it. 

Either way, we have a bit of a problem with no-balls being missed and I feel this could be a way to encourage umpires to be more confident in calling it.",Cricket,1575287246,whichonespinkterran,7,1,True,2019-12-02

466,ITT: Your lesser known cricketing stories,"As the title says, stories that might not be as commonly known. I'll start :-

1) A game was going on in Australia. Aussies were batting. Warne come out to the balcony where the rest of the team was sitting. Steve casually leaned over to Mark and shared some insight on the opposing team, match situation. Warne narrated this story, then capped it off with (and I paraphrase) ""the insight wasn't special, or even noteworthy. All I could take away from that interaction was that the twins actually spoke to each other. In all my years in the team together, I'd never seen that before.""

2) Pakistan was batting, and while Miandad was still at the crease, the others were getting out. A tai lender comes in, super nervous. Miandad straightaway asks him ""Kia karega?"" (what'll you do?). ""Bhagoonga."" (I'll run) he replies. Miandad then proceeds to build a nice partnership on quick twos. - I found it quite quirky, because Miandad didn't even offer a choice, just asked him, got a reply and conjured up a plan on it. 

3) Draved, in retirement, was asked if Talent is real. Contrary to popular opinion, he said yes. Went on to explain that if it wasn't real, why weren't other kids who he'd been to camp with, who devoted far more time than him (and he know known for his hard work and dedication), slept with their bats, loved the game completely, were nowhere near the heights that much hard work should have gotten them. 

4) Daniel Vettori was asked his first cricketing autograph. He said Kapil Dev. Said he wasn't even into collecting autographs, just made a real effort to get Kapil's because he always admired him. I found that quite sweet.

&gt;**Post Match Interviews**:

**Joe Root, Man of the Match | England captain**: Felt pretty good from the start of the innings, was a tricky period at the start. I just tried to get the rhythm back in my batting, few technical things. Thankfully we got into a position where we could force a result. It was a really good pitch as a batter, really proud the way we played throughout the innings. Good comeback from the last match that we played last week. It was a shame about the rain today, about losing sessions earlier. We could have potentially played a bit differently. But that's part and parcel of the game. As I said we as a side want to learn quickly and make sure we become a much harder side to beat. We want to score really big totals and put sides under pressure. We have learnt a lot, it's been very good in many ways. We need to make sure we carry the lessons we learn here ahead. We are very fortunate to have the support that we do, extremely grateful.

**Kane Williamson | New Zealand captain:** It was a great fight over the last couple of weeks, we know how strong as a unit they are. The first match for us was a fantastic win and to come back here and play like this was again a good effort. To lose both tosses but show that fight was pleasing to see. We lost a bit of time due to weather, but from our perspective it was great to see. Guys wanted the ball and collectively it was a good effort. We have a tough challenge coming up. It was a great contribution by Daryl in his first match. It was a tough surface for the seamers. Australia are a very good team, so it's always tough going there. We have to adapt to the challenges that we are presented with.

491,What are your thoughts on Ravichandran Ashwin removing his pads for the last ball of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Final? Isn't that bending the rules a little too much?,"In final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament of 2019 played between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, Vijay Shankar got out on the penultimate ball of the match trying to convert a single into a double.  This brought Murugan Ashwin into the crease with Tamil Nadu needing 3 of the last ball to win the match. Ravi Ashwin who was in the non-striker sent his pads away for the last ball.  
However, this did not matter as Murugan Ashwin could not get the ball go further than a couple of yards from the pitch resulting in Tamil Nadu only scoring a single and Karnataka winning by 1 run.  


I feel even though what Ravichandran Ashwin was not against the rules, I feel it's bending the rules too much. I mean if he wanted to get the extra yards in, why did he not face K Gowtham without the pads earlier in the over when he was on strike.  


This strategy could be used by anyone and could change the results of a lot of matches. For instance, take the match between India and Bangladesh in the World T20 at Bengaluru on Mar 23 2016. On the last ball of the match, when the Bangladeshi batsman missed the ball and Dhoni ran towards the stumps and dislodged the bails, which resulted in India winning that match. In that match, if the non-striker was wearing pads he might have reached the crease before Dhoni could dislodge bails and the match would have been a tie.

57,Time for India to consider Suryarkumar Yadav for T20s?,"1000+ runs in the last 2 IPL seasons and this season he's been killing it in both Vijay Hazare and Syed Mushtaq Ali. Even in the Dedohar Trophy, he played a crazy cameo with hardly 7-8 overs left in the innings. Considering India pretty much have no finishers / big-hitters down the order apart from Hardik Pandya (with all due respect to both Krunal and Washington, I doubt if they can deliver with the bat day in and day out), don't you think it's time for the team management to start considering Suryakumar Yadav for T20 cricket? Now that they've all but chucked DK out of the set-up, SKY is someone who can play a similar role, he's a batsman of a similar prototype - can re-build if needed and can tee-off like mad towards the end if needed.  With Dube also relatively young to International Cricket, I feel India might be in a situation where Pandya will be under way too much pressure to close the innings off. Someone like a SKY might just be perfect for the team. Thoughts?  


P.S. I know most of his runs in the IPL came up the order, but I think he has shown enough (both in the past in the IPL and now in domestic cricket) that he can be an able finisher.",Cricket,1573802145,anirudh1595,20,1,True,2019-11-15

131,Maybe Dhoni is going through a mentally tough time as well.,"The last competitive game Dhoni has played was the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand. He has taken his time off and said that he is currently unavailable, even for the West Indies Series this December. 
Recently, we've seen quite some players take time off citing mental health issues. Tackling such issues is never an easy phase of one's life and it's good to see players coming out of the stigma associated with it and begin to speak out. 
Maybe, just maybe even Dhoni is going through some mental health issues of his own. Dhoni, being the person he is, isn't very open and is a pretty quite person. Just like on the cricket field, he doesn't express how and what he feels out into the open. 
So, instead of coming out and speaking out about what he is going through, he's decided to take some time off, get himself together, develop a new model of playing the game and comeback. Spending some time with other things he loves and taking the mind off cricket might really help. 
And YES, MSK Prasad did say that they would be moving on, but we never know. Might be M.S Dhoni 3.0 in the making.

Moreover, PSL 2020 teams that are yet to win their first title will also make an effort to get the top spot. Lahore Qalandars that is a fan favorite, but has to struggle a lot to make it to the finals. Whereas, Karachi Kings the biggest team of the biggest city is also without any solid wins.  So, the underdog teams are likely to score big this year.

Another underdog and for now the youngest team in the mix Multan Sultan is also aiming for #1. The Sultans do not have many platinum class players under their banner. But still, they manage to put on a good show. This year they are expecting to score some big names. If such happens then they will be able to cement their chances towards the PSL 2020 finals.

&amp;#x200B;

[PSL 2020 News Updates](https://preview.redd.it/0b0vo8ywvwy31.jpg?width=560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d2376a64c3e36b0d96b8a59aabf9681c399f447)

**PSL 2020 Upcoming News, Behind the Scene Action**   

PSL 2020 is not just about cricket, it is about bringing people together in the spirit of unity and sportsmanship. Pakistan Super League is an event and as an event, it has many sideshows. The PSL 2020 behind the scene action is one of these sideshows. This allows the fans to see their favorite players give out some special messages and connect with them on a whole new level.

The BTS last year was memorable and many fans went crazy about it. On the entire social media, there was talk about the PSL 2019 over millions of posts and shares. Similarly, behind the scene action for PSL 2020 teams are going to be even bigger this year. As last year the time for BTS was limited due to a hand full of matches.

Therefore, this year as the entire PSL will be hosted by Pakistan time will not be an issue. As fans will get to see a lot more of their players and much more behind the scene action. Still, there are few limitations on the media networks on how to cover the locker room secrets. But we will still get all the good bits.

Moreover, as all goes according to plan PSL 2020 live streaming will provide us with the biggest event yet. As four major venues around Pakistan are going to host the series. These venues are likely to be Multan and Rawalpindi and will each hold a few matches at first as a test run. Lahore and Karachi will get the bigger share this year but, in the future, the Matches will be evenly distributed.

**Let’s Talk About the PSL 2020 Teams and Changes Predicted This Year** 

Islamabad United the two times winner and the team that managed to keep Quetta and Peshawar at bay. This year Islamabad United is looking to make a few key changes to their team. These changes, of course, will be to include new players that will increase their performance. Even from last year’s loss Islamabad United is a strong team and is not the one to be taken lightly. Last year Luke Ronchi was able to captivate the audience with his bat and field, receiving the safe hands award. This year Islamabad United is looking to score some more platinum class players.

The PSL 2020 live streaming will display all the new players making into the PSL 2020 teams. As all the teams are looking to enter new foreign players, only the best names will make it forward. Fans are eager to see Sammy, Pollard, Munro, Russell, De Villiers, and Bravo in action again. Making this the biggest international event in Pakistan’s history.

**Quetta Gladiators**

The winners of last year under the captaincy of Sarfaraz Ahmed. Quetta Gladiators went from veterans of the finals to straight-off champions. This year they will have to work even harder to maintain their title. Otherwise, one of the others will take it from them. Many experts speculate that as Quetta Gladiators are sure to lose their title this year. As no team has been able to win two consecutive seasons.

So, either Quetta Gladiators will lose their title or be the first team to win two years in a row. But things are already not looking well for Quetta as their capital Sarfaraz Ahmed is under a lot of fire. This is due to the national team’s poor performance in the World Cup. Plus, the bad T20 matches against Siri Lanka.

Sarfaraz Ahmed is no longer the captain of the Pakistan team and even his seat in the team is in jeopardy. So, things are looking grim for this Gladiator, to make it into the PSL 2020 teams.       

**Multan Sultans**

As they went from a change in ownership, the Multan Sultans are quite a popular team. They represent the other half of Punjab and are rivals to Lahore Qalandars. The team is owned by Ali Tareen son of Jahangir Tareen, a close friend of the Prime Minister of Pakistan. So, the amount of support for the Multan Sultans has only doubled over the years.

In Addition, Multan is going to host a hand full of matches in its stadium. Having all this in one mix is enough to let the fans go crazy on the streets. Multan is going to host its first international cricket event in decades. So, the fans are ready for a nostalgic feeling as they visit their beloved stadium again.  

As the Prime Minister of Pakistan is also a legendary Cricketer of his time. This year he may make a special appearance during one of the matches. So[,](https://sportszilla.org) stay tuned to the PSL 2020 live streaming, as this year will blow you away.

**Lahore Qalandars**

Lahore Qalandars are among the most beloved PSL 2020 teams and are among the favorite to win. Fans of Lahore Qalandars expect a great win every year but every year they are disappointed. But this has not stopped the owner Mr. Fawad Rana from trying his best to support his dream. So, this year the saints of Lahore might finally make it to the top an become the fifth champion of the HBL PSL 2020.

There is no doubt that Lahore is a strong team, their captain Muhammad Hafeez is a well-respected player. Plus, his experience in cricket is also admirable. Many call him, the Professor of cricket due to his technique and abilities. But these abilities have are not being able to take them so far.

This year Lahore Qalandars are looking to make some changes to their team. Moreover, if we follow the rumors correctly then the Qalandars are going to play a bit more aggressive this time. Their hunger for the title is going to be at its peak and they are the most favorite to win this year. Although this high placement might just be to troll the fans.

**Karachi Kings**

Karachi Kings the team with the wings is also famished. They are aiming for the championship for the last four years but they are unable to reach the semifinals. The road to the semi-finals is overtaken by Islamabad United, Peshawar Zalmi, and Quetta Gladiators. As these three teams are always tackling each other in the finals.

This year as the underdogs of the PSL 2020, Karachi Kings will aim to rid the finals of these three teams. Fans of Karachi Kings are tired of sitting at the bottom of the scoreboard. The only saving grace they have had so far is Lahore Qalandars and Multan Sultan at accompanying it to the lower ends.

Imad Wasim took on the responsibilities as captain last year and was able to keep a moderate streak. Karachi Kings played ten matches and won five with five loses. This puts them in the middle of the scoreboard but still towards the lower ends. Karachi Kings are looking to strengthen their batting side this year and aim to win the title of champions form Quetta Gladiators.   

**Peshawar Zalmi**

One of the strongest teams in the tournament Peshawar Zalmi has lots of batting power behind them. This is the reason they are able to make it to the finals so easily. Their tug of war with Quetta and Islamabad is worthy of making each highlight. In addition[,](https://sportszilla.org/psl-teams-2020/) Sammy and Pollard are among the absolute favorites among fans.

Last year there wasn’t a place in Lahore and Karachi where you didn’t see a picture of Darren Sammy. So, the chances of Peshawar Zalmi taking the crown from Quetta are relatively high. Their experience, coordination, and team play are all high. Plus, their owner Javed Afridi knows how to make his team stronger. This year Peshawar Zalmi is on its way to make some the team even better with many hard hitters.

The PSL 2020 live streaming will be able to shed some light as to which players are able to make it into the drafts. But Peshawar Zalmi is looking to play it strong this year. As they seek to maintain their high standards as one of the top PSL 2020 teams.

**No Major Changes Will Occur in The PSL 2020 Schedule**

There are many speculations going on around the internet that the PSL 2020 schedule may change. Many experts themselves are pointing towards the security issues that can arise in the upcoming month. But the PSL officials are looking to host the entire season in Pakistan and no changes are expected.

During their meeting with Chairman PCB, Mr. Ehsan Mani the PSL officials agreed to host the matches in Pakistan.  They are displaying their true confidence in Pakistan’s ability to host such an international event. In addition[,](https://sportszilla.org/psl-schedule-2020/) with the successful tour of Siri Lanka during September and October. Which was so far the biggest international tour of any cricket team in Pakistan.

The security of the venues and team was approved to be of the highest standard. So, following this the international community is beginning to trust the security conditions in Pakistan. This year Pakistan is looking to attract many foreign guests and cricketers. Finally, able to recognize its dream of livening up its stadiums.

**Prediction for the PSL 2020 Teams Winning this Year**

Looking at it as a statistical point of view Quetta Gladiators are going to lose their title this year. As for the winners Karachi Kings is likely to be the best candidate as their progress dictates. Karachi was able to maintain a moderate score last year and their team has room for improvement. Teams like Peshawar Zalmi and Islamabad United are at their best and will make no major changes.

Although many will seek to increase their power and technique. But the team with the best balance of players as bowlers, fielders, and batsmen will take the title. Karachi Kings is well on its way to make this balance and with a few more tweak they will be able to make it into the finals.

The best option to enhance your prediction is to watch the PSL 2020 live streaming of the opening ceremony. As we know which player will make it into the PSL 2020 drafts, a better prediction can be formed. But overall a well-balanced team is likely to win the championship as seen previously.

So, as many national players make it into their new homes. we will eagerly look forward to the PSL 2020 live streaming of the opening ceremony. So, fans can stay tuned for our prediction for the PSL 2020 winners. Which we will make after carefully analyzing every aspect of the PSL 2020 teams.",Cricket,1573850608,10hunts,4,1,True,2019-11-15

RCB goes into the auctions with a purse of Rs 27.90 crores.
Here is the Incomplete/Pre-Auction XI
1.Paddikal
2.Parthiv Patel (WK)
3.Virat Kohli
4.AB de Villiers ✈️
5.Moeen Ali
6.Dube/Gurkeerat
7.Washington Sundar/Pawan Negi
8.Umesh Yadav
9.Navdeep Saini
10.Mohammad Siraj
11.Chahal

Right now we can see some glaring weaknesses in the top, middle and lower order, and we have to prioritize our auction on getting the best xi but replacement players as well from our small auction purse. Here are some of our biggest weaknesses

**Mediocre top-order**
-Although paddikal seems to be doing good at the moment, he is still unproven and hasn’t played that many t-20s. On the other hand Parthiv Patel 
-Likely acquisitions- Tripathi, Munro, Morgon, Uthappa (WK)
**Middle Order needs finishing touches**
-While it isn’t abysmal (no middle order with virat and AB is), Its still nothing to write home about. Moeen ali did good during the last IPL, but he has been inconsistent across the world. There is also no replacement for sundar who himself is more of a number 8 player than a 7. 
-Likely Acquisitions- Mahmudullah, Neesham, Stoinis (at a lower price), Sam curran, Alex Carey
**Lower Order needs foreign pacers**
We need foreign pacers because we really can’t be taken seriously if we have both Umesh and Siraj lmao.
Likely acquisitions- Cummins, Starc, Coulter-nile (at a lower-price), cotterell

**Final Overseas  Players**  (Hopefully)
-ABD
-Moeen Ali
-Mahmudullah
-Stoinis/Curran
-Cummins/Starc
-Coulter-nile/Steyn/cotterell
-IDK some batsman
-Morgan/Munro

**Final XI (Hopefully)**
1. Tripathi/Paddikal
2. Parthiv/Uthappa (WK) 
3. Virat Kohli
4. AB de villiers ✈️
5. Moeen Ali/Mahmudullah ✈️
6. Alex Carey/Stoinis ✈️
7. Dube/Gurkeerat
8. Sundar
9. Umesh/Siraj but hopefully cummins/starc ✈️
10. Saini
11. Chahal

Honestly if this is our xi we have a pretty good chance to win, but of course that's not gonna happen so for shits and giggles here is a realistic RCB xi

1. Paddikal(Putting all our weight on a newcomer and destroying his future)
2. Parthiv Patel (Ironically the 3rd best Batsman)
3. Lynn ✈️
4. Virat
5. AB ✈️
6. Hetmyer ✈️
7. Dube
8. Pawan Negi (cause sundar will never get a chance)
9. Ali Khan or some other irrelevant bowler that we will pay 12 cr for ✈️
10. Saini
11. Chahal

199,How should Pakistan line up for the 1st Test vs Australia?,"1. Shan Masood - Played well in both  the tour games, getting two 50s. I feel like he's a lock at 1 or 3.


2. Azhar Ali - He's the captain, so despite recent poor performances, he will play.

3. Asad Shafiq - Locked his place with two centuries in the tour matches

4. Babar Azam - Our best bat. No words needed he will play.

5. Iftikhar Ahmed - He's not rated by fans but he's played pretty well recently in the SL series, the T20Is and in the tour matches too.

6. Haris Sohail - Now this one I am not sure about. If you asked me before the last few times I saw him bat, I'd have said he was a lock. But he's been pretty poor recently. I would still give him the first test but I wouldn't be surprised if Abid Ali or Imam replaces him up the order.

7. M. Rizwan - Wicket-Keeper so he's a lock. But he's got a good first class record and had been knocking on Sarfraz's door for a while now, massive opportunity for him to grasp that keeper spot for good.

8. Yasir Shah - Probably the best Pakistani test bowler of the last decade. Decent with the bat but wouldn't call him an all rounder which means Pakistan will have a long tail.

9. Mohammad Abbas - Senior bowler, leader of the attack, amazing record and didn't have a good series in South Africa so he'll be eager to bounce back.

10. Shaheen Afridi - Odd to call him a senior bowler but it feels like he's been around for a while now. Supremely talented and had a decent test debut series in South Africa.

11. Imran Khan - IMO he cemented his place with that five wicket haul in the game vs Australia A.

**TL;Dr- Kumble good, you can ignore my ramblings and directly go to assessment portion, also, the buys- 1) Morgan, 2) Starc/Cummins/ncn, 3) braithwaite/holder, 4) Grandhomme/neesham, 5) prabhsimran singh(wk), 6) harpreet Singh, 7) spinner Kumble likes**


Let me start of by the fact that I hate this team, giving me heartbreak every year and still I am come back to it like a Stockholm victim. This year i come back only due to one man, Kumble, the Jumbo himself. 

Kumble is a smart person and capable leader. Though not perfect, as I do believe the tussle between him and Koach was problems from both sides, Kumble is a proven leader. His record In ipl- 

2009- led Rcb to finals, 2010- led ipl to semis, 2013- joined MI and they won their first ipl under him, 2015- another ipl, and then resigned for India's position. Ofcourse it didn't work out much, and he took a semi break and then fortunately! Kings got him! Not like that he had a choice, MI has jayawardena and ambanis, csk- Fleming, dd-ponting, srh- moody, kkr- kallis+ their entire management, rr- shane warne, and rcb has Koach and flavour of the season coach

So Kumble came to kings, with addition of Karnataka players+ minimal interference of management because they are all dumb dumbs. 

I have high hopes from Kumble to rightfully assess our pitch, team, our weaknesses and then lead us to another final.


#assessment of Kings

XI- 

1) Gayle- opener

2) Rahul-opener

3)Mayank- backup opener+no.3

4) Sarfaraz/nair- accumulator

5) Pooran/Mandeep-finisher

6) a pace alrounder

7)Gowtham/brar- spin alrounders

8) m Ashwin

9) mujeeb/suchith

10) shami/nalkande/arshdeep

11) foreign pace bowler/viljoen



16 players, 9 spots left, with 4 foreign spots. 

Current form of our first XI is really good! Gayle has always given us runs, Rahul has the been best batsman of last two ipls together, Mayank suffered mentally, but he has solved his issue and will easily come good for us, Pooran is a good keeper+finisher, Sarfaraz and kaptain can keep the scoreboard running

Bowling wise, Gowtham is good, M.ashwin always is good for us, Mujeeb has been the no.3 bowler In t20I, shami has been top 3 bowler for India in all formats, AND, we have Nalkande, who is right now the second highest wicket taker in Syed trophy! Always good to have a young Indian pacer in form! 

Our deficiencies:- 

1) Middle order experienced batsman 

2) pace alrounder

3) a foreign pace bowler

4) a captain

Let's start with the first- a problem found in all ipl sides rn. You need someone at no.4/5 to have the ability to read the game and tonk it well! While I do trust Pooran to come good, he doesn't have much Ipl experience. Likes of sarfaraz/nair/Mandeep Singh could be handy, but will fail under pressure. 

This problem can be solved if combined with no.6 pace alrounder problem, so combining them

Problem 1) experienced pace alrounder+ middle order bat-&gt; 

Many ask why we released Curran, while stats do not tell full story, they do indicate something. Sam has promise but he ain't a finished product. Considering 2021 is a mega auction, we need an instant fix and not a future investment, specially one that costs 7 crore. My picks are:-

a) Braithwaite

b) holder

c) woakes

d) cutting

e) Grandhomme

f) neesham

g) Morris

This is not in any order, but I am biased towards Windies alrounders who are big game players, and given enough timez always come good for their ipl teams! New Zealand alrounders are always handy champions to have too! 

We should buy two foreign alrounders because we need backup anyway and there are no Indian ones in the market

Problem 2- **FOREIGN PACE BOWLERS**: 

yeah, we need one. Shami is amazing, but he needs someone better to partner him up! There are multiple good options out there:-

a) Starc

b) Cummins

c) hazlewood

d) Phehlukwayo

e) Jordan

f) woakes

g) Henry

h) Steyn

I) coulternile

again, not in any order, but should be a good experienced one. I have a theory that if you are a top pacer in the international level, you will succeed in Ipl for sure, barring injuries. We will definitely get one Australian pacer, I just hope whichever we get - Cummins, Starc, hazlewood, or ncn, we get the one who actually plays the entire ipl. 

**Captain problems**- there is lack of captaining options, the best bet out there is Kl rahul. His spot in team is permanent, he is our best player and the only one worthy of it. But his mental game lacks things, and idk if he would step up for captain role. I don't want his game to suffer because of added responsibility. He is the ace of the team. 

Kumble himself said he won't announce a captain until they know the full squad, it's a smart move as it opens possibility for someone else. The most preferred option would be a foreign international captain, the likes of two- 1) Morgan, 2) Kane(if srh are kind) 3) holder

Holder ain't tested for Ipl, so forget captaincy, but he is a good intl captain no doubt. Kane is my fantasy, so let's not count that lol

Preferred option- Morgan. He will play the entire ipl because of t2020, he is explosive, experienced middle order batsman and top 3 leaders in intl cricket. Only problem would be that we would have to discard Gayle, or use him as horses for courses thing, but seeing his age, it might not be bad thing. So with Morgan, our XI could be:-

1) kl Rahul

2) Mayank 

3) sarfaraz Khan/ Nair/Mandeep

Has the potential to be a landscaping changing superstar in limited overs/T20 in the future, hope he gets to play for India in 2021 T20 WC/2023 ODI WC!","I was just watching Shaw's comeback 50 highlights and saw that Riyan Parag dismissed him eventually.

I know he is just 18 and has a lot of time in his hands. But, a batting allrounder who can bowl fairly decent wicket taking leg spin has got me really excited. (He took 3 wickets in that innings when he dismissed Shaw)

Can you think of anyone in the international circuit who has such a prolific combination of skill set? (Primary skill = Batting but can bowl wicket taking/partnership breaking leg spin!)

Besides Steve Smith and Afridi, I really can't recollect another leg spinning batting allrounder (although Afridi was a quantum allrounder, oscillating between being a batting and bowling allrounder due to his inconsistencies, and Smudge a batsman for practical purposes, a GOAT one at that), hence I think he could be worth his weight in gold for his IPL team in the near future and for Team India (I hope they blood him soon though at 5 hopefully in ODI/T20, since the Indian team does not usually have a reputation to blood in raw talent straightaway, like the way the new Eng team has done for example with Archer/Banton etc.)

I feel under the Steve Smith's captaincy at RR, who can perhaps relate to him the most, Riyan has a great chance to fine tune his own batting methodology that works against pace and spin alike.

And if he can also equally devote time to pick Shane Warne's brains on leg spin while at RR, boy oh boy do we have a future superstar in the making or what, a kind that has seldom been come across in the past, and a potential role model for the future!",Cricket,1574015215,harycane,14,1,True,2019-11-17

373,Who is the worst player of the decade?,"The decade is coming to an end, and so as expected, posts upon posts have been made on the test, ODI and T20 team of the decade. Everybody wants to know your team of the decade, just so they can tell you why you're wrong. Where is Smith? You don't have Sangakkara are you kidding?! What the fuck is Keaton Jennings doing there? Everyone has an opinion

Everybody talks about best... but no one talks about the worst? Well this is usually because if you play badly you get dropped and no one remembers you, but lucky for you I remember\*, I always remember. (\*Ok Statsguru remembers, but that's not really the point is it). So.. I give you the worst test, ODI and T20i batsman/bowler of the decade. Buckle up and prepare to think, how the fuck did that guy play 10+ internationals.

As much as I'd love to give this to some unfortunate bowler who was discarded after one test (sorry Mason), I think some filters are necessary. For batsmen, they need to play over 20 innings in positions 1-6 (1-7 for Tests), and for bowlers they needed to have bowled in over 20 innings and average more than a certain amount of overs per innings, otherwise some part time rubbish could slip through the gaps ([Sorry Virat](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=bowling_average;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin1=20;qualval1=innings_bowled;size=150;spanmin1=01+jan+2010;spanval1=span;template=results;type=bowling)). For T20s, I will take the arbitrary Batting Index measure (Average + Strike rate) to decide for batsman and use my judgement for the bowlers.

TESTS

**Batsman**

Theunis de Bruyn. 428 runs at 18.95, 1 100

In FC Cricket, Theunis averages a very healthy 44 from 65 tests, but in tests, it is less than half of that. He started in very tough conditions away from home in NZ and England, and at home against Australia. He was in last chance saloon territory against Sri Lanka, averaging 14.44 in 5 tests, but managed to make a sensational 4th innings century in unfortunately a losing cause. This is it, we all thought. Theunis has hacked Test Cricket! Well... not exactly. After that test he averages 17.63. Sorry Theunis

**Bowler**

Rubel Hossain. 33 wickets at 82.30, 1 5fer

Unlike de Bruyn, Hossian averages 53.64 in FC Cricket which gives a pretty good idea that he won't be very good at test level, which I think is mentioned about a trillion times a day on match threads when he's playing. He has still managed to play 24 tests this decade (6 more times than Shane Bond ever did). His lowest average in a year is 53.16 in 2014, and lowest average against an opponent (except Zimbabwe) is 72.50 against Sri Lanka. Why did he play so much? Well there was no one really coming through. In fact, using my filters, 4 of the worst 7 bowlers this decade are from Bangladesh

ODIs

**Batsman**

Mohammad Ashraful. 316 runs at 14.36. SR: 57.76

Ashraful is rightfully most well known as the 16 year old who took the world by storm in 2001 scoring Bangladesh's first test century. Fortunately what is not talked about is his ODI form in the 2010s. He passed 32 once in 23 innings, and never scored at a SR faster than 80. His career ended in unfortunate circumstances.. but perhaps it was for the best.

**Bowler**

PADLR Sandakan. 17 wickets at 60.64. Econ: 6.43

You can see why Sri Lanka picked him. He had a reasonable record and a very unorthodox action, and there was a chance he could be like Ajantha Mendis. He started off fine, taking 2/33 on debut, but by the end of 2018, he averaged 46.18. Sri Lanka stuck with him in 2019 and were rewarded with a brilliant 292 runs in 5 innings. As for his bowling, he manag- wait what? Those 292 runs were *conceded* not scored? Ah ok then. He only managed 1 wicket and so his average of 292 gives him the worst yearly ODI average for 21 years. Yikes

T20s

**Batsman**

Khanwar Ali. 453 runs at 16.17. SR: 93.98

This is a little unfair to Khanwar. He averages a brilliant 18.41 with the ball in T20is, but for some reason he opens the batting with pretty disastrous results. He only has 3 40+ scores in 28 innings, which to be fair to him are all at least 140+ SR, but he is far too inconsistent to be persisted with

**Bowler**

Paras Khadka. 5 wickets at 57.80. Econ: 7.04

T20 bowling is quite hard to judge, but I went with Paras because although his Economy is reasonable, his average is *so* bad. It is more than 15 runs worse than second place, and just qualifies with 20 innings, bowling 2.05 overs per innings (my T20 minimum is 2). Any statistical reason why Paras is so bad? Well not really, he just doesn't take any wickets. He has played against 13 different nations, yet has only taken wickets against 3 of them.

&amp;#x200B;

So concludes my dive into the worst players of the decade. If you're talking Kohli, Steyn, Borthwick, Williamson, I don't want to talk but if we're talking Sandakan or de Bruyn then I'm all ears.

I want to point out that this is very surface level analysis so apologies if I've missed anything glaring

392,"AMA Announcement: Tim Wigmore &amp; Freddie Wilde, Wednesday, 20th Nov, 5:00 PM GMT","Tim Wigmore writes for _The Daily Telegraph_, and has previously been published with _The Economist_, various ESPN sites including _ESPNcricinfo_, and _The New York Times_. 

Freddie Wilde is an analyst and columnist with the cricket data company Cricviz. He has written for _ESPNcricinfo_, _Hindustan Times_, _Cricbuzz_, and _The Independent_. He is an analyst for the Melbourne Renegades in the BBL, the Oval Invincibles in The Hundred, among other teams. 

Their new book [_Cricket 2.0: Inside the T20 Revolution_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZJVJQJP/), is their answer to the myriad questions that sprung up in their many conversations about cricket's newest format. 

In their own words: ""_Over the last couple of years, we have interviewed more than 50 players, coaches and administrators involved in T20 in search of answers built a T20 dynasty, and what the future will hold. This book is the result._""

***

I am currently midway through the book, and I highly recommend it.

It charts beautifully the course of T20 cricket, starting from the cluelessness of the first professional T20 game in England, through the fearlessness of Brendon McCullum that kickstarted the IPL, the sheer impact of Chris Gayle, the scarcely-believable genius of AB, right to the proliferation of domestic leagues around the globe. 

It mixes this with a keen analytical look, peppered with detailed stats nuggets, at how the compressed format has changed the grammar of the game, although it outwardly looks the same. How risk-taking has been redefined, how spinners have trumped the early cries of their demise, and how fast bowling is a nuanced but thankless art. 

Also covered is the rise of BCCI as the cricketing epicentre of the world, the magic of the West Indies in the shortest format, the way T20 spreads cricket to corners yet untouched, and predictions for the future of cricket.

If you thought of T20 as cricket, this book forces a rethink: it prises apart conventions and cliches and investigates the innermost dynamics of T20, as well its historical evolution. It gives T20 the status of a different game altogether, and sets a benchmark for how to study it, think about it, and talk about it.

8. Cummins
9. Bumrah
10. Lyon
11. Rabada

Pujara is slightly out of position, but the guy is a total sponge and soaks up pressure better than anyone at the moment. Agarwal is scoring runs for fun. Williamson and Kholi have been the backbones for their respective test teams for so long, it would be ridiculous not to include them. Smith - need we justify his selection after the Ashes? Stokes is for me the X-Factor player and is the best genuine allrounder in the world (plus his form with the bat is amazing). de Kock is the best wkt-bat at the moment; I might've given the gloves to Saha but De Kock offers a little more with the bat. Cummins, Bumrah and Rabada are the three best quick bowlers on the planet right now, with Shami coming in fourth place (hence he isnt in the team). Lyon is, for me, the best spinner, who performs both at home and abroad (unlike Indian spinners who seem to be so much more effective at home than away).

A note on the captaincy too - even before Smith's temporary ban from the captaincy I would have picked Williamson as my captain. There are three potential captains in this team: Smith, Williamson and Kholi. Kholi is far too emotional and has a habit of getting sucked in to emotional decision making when his team is either doing very well or very badly. Smith has an excellent cricketing brain and doesnt get sucked into emotion stuff as much as Kholi, but Williamson seems to handle pressure better than both of these guys while still being able to score runs and deploy amazing tactics (I mean, look at the CWC 2019 - Williamson almost carried NZ singlehandedly to the final).

465,South African Quota System: Non-political Discussion.,"On a different I was thinking about the alleged ills of the quota system. Lots of people say, oh it should only apply below the international level, you shouldn't compromise international cricket. I won't get into that, but as someone who isn't South African or particularly aware of SA domestic/club cricket I can't really judge how it's working at that level.

However, when I think about the international players it's affected, I don't see how it's an issue. I think the whingeing about losing players is a little misplaced/excessive. And people unfairly blame it for white players at the margins.

Let's look at some notable Kolpakers.

1) Simon Harmer? Some people talk about Harmer as if he's fucking S. Warne. He wasn't a god like in the 5 Tests he played or his long first class career. I read that he's done well in the championship but since when should that be reason for longing? A FC average of 27 doesn't suggest SA are missing some spin king. He could've had a longer go on merit, but   
more importantly at the time I'm not sure Maharaj in Tests and Tahir in white ball weren't smarter preferences without even considering race. For the most part Maharaj has proven himself on merit anyway.

2 &amp; 3) Abbot and Olivier: Both were going to play for SA but chose money because the Brexit/Kolpak window was expected to close without further warning. That's an issue with the fact that CSA is poor and the rand is weak while some counties are rich.

3) KP: He just wasn't that good as a teenager and decided to leave SA at 19. No one but his mentor believed that this ordinary teenage off-spinner was a cut-price Viv in the making.

4) Morkel: He could've played Tests for another year or two but there really wasn't a spot for him considering Steyn wanted to play on. Even without the quota system Morkel was competing with Philander, Rabada, Ngidi and Steyn for 3 spots. It made sense for him to retire. There wasn't a spot for an ageing possibly greatest fast bowler of all time and ageing very good fast bowler in the same side. He might have been handy in India with Philanderer being toothless, Ngidi being injured and Steyn retired but 

Looking through this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Kolpak\_cricketers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kolpak_cricketers) I don't see any tragedies or great losses whatsoever. Most are dudes at the end of their careers, trying to maximise their earnings. There's plenty of mediocre white - and black, if Ashwell Prince was black - players.

People hate on the quota system, and yeah there's that semi-final to think of but how has the quota system concretely hurt the success of the SA Test side?

There is no white Basil D'oliveira because none of the players that have gone to England are treasures and it's obviously not the apartheid anymore.

3,What are your stories about meeting cricketers?,"Just intrigued to hear your stories

Here is one of mine

So it was the 2017 Champions Trophy, and I was one of those flag bearers. First of all, during the anthem, Wayne Parnell sees that I was absolutely buzzing and gives me a smile and a pat on the back.

After that, the flag bearers were allowed on the pitch to play some cricket. But since we were on the pitch, me and 2 mates decided to take advantage. We see Kagiso Rabada warming up, sneak out of our little game and run over to him. We ask him for an autograph on our shirts, and he said after a ball. He is ridiculously fast up close. He signed our shirts, but then something else caught our eye. Kumar Sangakkara and Graeme Smith walking along. Naturally, all of the kids would bombard Sanga for an autograph, but me and my mates recognised Smith and he gave an autograph, and then jokingly said 'I'm surprised you recognised me' (what a legend). Then we ran over and got Sanga's.

So what are your stories?",Cricket,1572458835,PopeShashcan49,95,64,True,2019-10-30

191,Can someone be both a basketballer and a cricketer in the same time?,"I am 13 years old, I live in northern alberta, canada, and want to be a player in the NBA and also play cricket professionaly in Pakistan. My skills in both sports are pretty good, and I can, at least I think, make the NBA or cricket professionaly because I am tall, and I work very hard. My question is, dont worry about skills but if someone has the skills, is it fundametally possible to be both a basketball player in the NBA and a cricketer in the same time?",Cricket,1572649707,Yotuberfrench,4,0,True,2019-11-01
192,Could India's 2nd XI beat anyone at home?,"Since England's series win in India in 2012, India have played 32 matches at home. They have won 26, drawn 5 and lost 1(Smith and SOK masterclass).

This begs the question, could India's 2nd XI remain a dominant force at home. It is trivial the gap between the opposition and the second stringers would narrow but by how much? 

Assessing the players who have been in and out of the Indian squad in recent times and those who have been performing remarkably well for India A, I believe the 2nd XI would look something similar to this:

1. Prithvi Shaw
2. KL Rahul
3. Priyank Panchal 
4. Shubman Gill 
5. oh kaptain my kaptain  (c)
6. Rishabh Pant  (wk)
7. Hardik Pandya 
8. Ishant Sharma
9. Kuldeep Yadav
10. Umesh Yadav 
11. Shahbaz Nadeem 

Currently, Bumrah (1st team), Pandya and Shaw are unavailable so Ishant would go into the first team. I would suspect Abhimanyu Easwaran (opener), Jalaj Saxena/ Shivam Dube (all rounders) and Mohammed Siraj (bowler) would be the replacements.

Minor concern is that the tail is slightly long.

Over a 3+ match series, I could see NZ winning the series and quite possibly OZ if they can find a second spinner.  I can't see anyone else getting close.",Cricket,1572652278,coolestbeans2000,31,3,True,2019-11-01

196,The year is 2028...," ***The year is 2028, and the PA system is announcing the new batsman en route to the crease in Houston.***

*“Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the crease, Hoosiers captain and Australian international, Chris Green!”*

*The crowds at Moosa Stadium give a lukewarm response to the Hoosiers’ lower-order hitter, but cannot help singing along to his walk-on music: Kasabian’s classic rock song ‘Underdog’. Appreciative though they may be of his musical choices, they are willing him to fail: if he can help his team score the 38 runs they need from the final four overs, then they will jump the Ranchers into second place of the American League West and join the Stars in the Playoffs.*

*If he’s to do it though, he’ll have to survive two overs of spin from the ambidextrous Prashanth Nair, whose unusual skillset has made him something of a global star having found game time in both India and Australia thanks to his excellent MLC performances.*

*It doesn’t take him long to dismiss Green, but ultimately the seventh-wicket pair of Welsh international Nye Donald, and Green’s replacement: 28-year-old keeper Emmanuel Stewart, himself a Grenadian international, were able to find enough boundaries to make their 26-game regular season campaign a successful one. ESPN pundits John Davison and Jarrod Kimber spend half an hour in the studio analysing the match-ups between the Indy Hoosiers and their American League semi-final opponents, the Raleigh Oaks.*

*Viewers are baffled when Kimber again makes reference to a man called “Ed Cowan” who apparently existed a long time ago.*

&amp;#x200B;

[Kimber, pictured here many years before he baffles thousands of Americans by trying to explain who Ed Cowan was.](https://preview.redd.it/h22xbledf6w31.jpg?width=628&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef3adf700d73a95a5c7819bfacc4a37b7182f46f)

**=========================================================================================**

If this all seems farfetched, that is because it absolutely is. There is no 20-team Major League Cricket competition, and no Indy Hoosiers, Texan Ranchers or Raleigh Oaks exist anywhere other than the frankly excessive number of spreadsheets that clog my hard drive.

And yet, every bit of this little anecdote is something that the ICC could, if the mood so took them, make possible. Twenty20 is doing its very best to drag cricket kicking and screaming into the 21st Century, much as Kerry Packer’s World Series Cricket finally managed to drag it into the 20th in the late 1970s. It is the job of the game’s administrators to let it do so.

At present, the Qualifier for the Twenty20 World Cup (the first edition to have been rebranded away from its original World Twenty20 moniker) is demonstrating a little of the potential that cricket really does have to grow. Countries like Namibia, Netherlands and Papua New Guinea have stamped themselves all over this tournament and look likely to finish as the top three teams involved, all of them ahead of Ireland who are (lest we forget) a Full Member nation.

&amp;#x200B;

[Talented cricketers come from all corners of the world these days.](https://preview.redd.it/uc9io7qmf6w31.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1c6dfa89507de6a055714e5556b2d70380e3cc)

Not only that, but some very strong cricket teams weren’t even able to qualify for this tournament: the United States, able to draw upon a pace attack of Ali Khan, Rusty Theron and Cam Gannon, didn’t make it. Nor did Nepal, or Germany. Their absence, through no greater reason than the merit of those who qualified ahead of them (save possibly for Nigeria, who were the beneficiaries of Zimbabwe’s heavy-handed punishment for some even heavier-handed administrative fraudulence) goes only to show the huge depth that is beginning to develop in international cricket.

So, naturally, the ICC intends to keep the main Twenty20 World Cup tournament at only twelve teams – even though Indian broadcaster Star has expressed an interest in an expanded format.

And so, naturally, the ICC apparently intends to dispense with the tournament which has provided such riveting cricket in recent weeks. Doing away with this, a tournament that exposes players from relative cricketing backwaters to world-class facilities, officials and, often, opposition.

Imagine instead, a 20-team World Twenty20 (sorry, the old name has just stuck for me). If the events of the last couple of weeks have shown us anything, it’s that there are definitely eight competitive Associate teams: look, for example at what Hong Kong achieved, even without the presence of their seven most talented eligible players. And look at what they achieved very recently against India.

Imagine that World Cup with four groups of five that progress into knockouts that will be broadcast around the world to an audience of millions, possibly billions.

No not *that* World Cup. A cricket one.

[Look what a well-run World Cup can achieve. Look at it.](https://preview.redd.it/o9s8zmkhg6w31.jpg?width=945&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca1b8bb6e9cbf951d78bbd0d3bda4b47a996c5b5)

Imagine also an international game not ruled by a small cabal of elite teams. A governing body which operates independently; or, failing that, which at least gives equal voting rights to India as it does to their neighbours Nepal. Contrary to popular belief amongst Indian cricket administrators, the rest of the world won’t vote against the hand that feeds them just because they can: so great is India’s share of the cricketing audience and revenue that it is in everyone else’s interests to keep them strong and profitable too.

Similarly, cricket has a few geographical quirks that do not exist in other sports. Take for example, the England cricket team. Or, as the name of its governing body suggests it should be called, the England and Wales cricket team. There is only one Welshman currently playing international cricket: Swansea-born Imad Wasim, for Pakistan. Although Sussex’s Phil Salt, who recently came moderately close to representing England, was born in North Wales, he is not so near the front of their queue to open the batting.

The arguments against a Welsh national team, so long as it was supported by the ECB to the extent of allowing at least the historic Glamorgan County Cricket Club to continue fielding Welsh players as locals, are ill-founded; it would bring cricket into line with almost every other sport in Wales, and might even persuade the people of Wales to give a little bit more of a shit about cricket.

Then there is the enduring curio that is the West Indies cricket team. Two-time World Champions in each of cricket’s limited-overs formats, the West Indies Cricket Board is in fact a composite organisation of more than a smaller national cricket boards. This has always been something of an uneasy alliance, but since the introduction of the Professional Cricket League in 2014, the situation has persisted in which a young cricketer in Jamaica will never actually be able to play cricket for his country; the PCL team is the Jamaica Scorpions, and has every right to just buy in a player from outside of Jamaica if they so fancy it.

[A Welsh cricket team has rarely been convened for more than the very occasional exhibition game.](https://preview.redd.it/3k7vczcug6w31.jpg?width=615&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=152ac45453c86f8b1c0159690f6595999bda174f)

While many of those smaller cricket boards would struggle to produce strong teams (hi, Montserrat), there are still plenty of them who would be able to put together very strong national teams: if their representation in Twenty20 competitions around the world is any barometer, Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad could still be world class forces.

And so far, I have talked only about those cricketing markets which are already being tapped (just badly). The United States is oft-discussed as a potential goldmine, given its tendency to take seriously pretty much any sport that catches their attention.

The difficulty that cricket will always have in the United States, though, is that there is already a competing bat-and-ball sport in the summer which has the advantage of being quite literally America’s pastime. In comparison to Major League Baseball, a hypothetical Major League Cricket would be courting the diaspora of generally-recognised cricket-playing nations and would likely aspire to the sorts of attendance figures of mid-range baseball Minor Leagues, and some rather niche TV deals.

Regardless, though, the idea of an all-American cricket league is the ultimate pipedream of many an expansionist cricketing administrator.

\- - -

Test cricket is extremely special; it is a unique spectacle that I would recommend to almost anyone else. If a Twenty20 league is the 20-episode television series, then Test cricket is the original bestselling novel that served as the source material for a more accessible interpretation. The novel, absolutely has its place. But plenty of people only know that the novel exists because the TV series caught their attention.

[Sometimes, a good TV series can bring mainstream attention to its parent novel.](https://preview.redd.it/gxqfhu25h6w31.jpg?width=825&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a027ad2e5a37c88878acd764eb53a2f8492565c4)

If we want to see the world play cricket, we need to show them the version of our game that has most grabbed people’s attention. And it doesn’t have to be the big, all-singing all-dancing Indian Premier League experience: anyone who has ever attended a night at England’s Twenty20 Blast competition can attest that it is a wonderful night out, and usually full to the rafters of kids getting into cricket.

*Live on ESPN, anchor Jarrod Kimber turns to studio guest Timroy Allen, the former USA and San Fran Bridgers all-rounder Timroy Allen. Allen consults his notes; “Well, it says here on his profile that Walker is a talented young spin bowler. Apparently he first saw cricket in 2017 when he was on holiday in England, and has been interested ever since. He says that for some time afterwards, his mother really didn’t approve of cricket, especially once he started watching videos of Rashid Khan well into the night.”*

*Kimber laughs, then asks, “Well I think I speak for everyone when I say we’ve all been there.”*

*Former LA Celestials coach Daniel Vettori agrees, which reminds everyone else that he’s actually still in the studio. “Yeah, couldn’t agree more Jarrod,” he says, “In my time as a coach it was always a pleasure to coach him, but a nightmare to try to prepare to play against him. It – “*

*Jarrod cuts him off in order to cut back to the stage.*

We all loved playing in the streets and the traditional methods used for picking who batted first and who bowled at which number, didn’t we?

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to bring back those nostalgic memories with its upcoming Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2020 draft. It is scheduled to be held in the first week of December according to some reports.

The cricket’s governing body has decided to go for either ‘Puggam Puggaai’ or numbering where numbers are written on the ground and hidden under the bat and players – in this case, franchises – pick one each. It will take place on 3rd November.

Earlier, the team finishing last in the previous season got the first pick in the draft, however, things will be decided differently, giving the already colorful draft ceremony a more interesting look.

According to the sources, the draft ceremony will be held at Gaddafi Stadium or Greater Iqbal Park in Lahore.

The remaining picks will be decided like the previous seasons. The move is aimed at associating the league with street cricket and giving everyone a blast from the past.

But basically, this is how the groups shape up. 

**Group A:**

Sri Lanka
Papua New Guinea
Ireland 
Oman

**Group B**

Bangladesh
Netherlands
Namibia
Scotland

So excited for this tournament, cannot wait. I think that there is a lot of potential for upsets here. Bangladesh without Shakib will be a much weaker proposition, plus the Bellerive Oval pitch in Hobart, will suit the fantastic Dutch pace bowling attack!

Scotland will be a huge threat, whilst Namibia also have the potential to go big (Look out for Gerhard Erasmus, JJ Smit and Kotze). 

----

Group A is also interestingly poised. I reckon Ireland can definitely upset Sri Lanka whilst PNG will be an unknown quantity for the Lankans also. 

Of course, I would rather that these teams get the opportunity to play against the big boys rather than go through another round of what are essentially qualifiers; and the ICC needs to change + expand the current format. But, nevertheless, it will be exciting and hoping for some big upsets. 

Who do you guys think will make the Super 12 out of these two groups?

Given the importance attached to the big, money-spinning tours by Australia and India, this **Six Nations** competition would occur every even-numbered year. So for 2022, the competitors would be New Zealand and South Africa.

[The Wisden Trophy, which would be presented to the winning team of Match One of this hypothetical tournament.](https://preview.redd.it/x2t0ufi2ldw31.jpg?width=980&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9106a1434b5374955e71d67fe2ded719aab96204)

And for those clashes which have perpetual trophies attached to them - like the Wisden Trophy between England and the West Indies - then that trophy would still be on the line for the Test match in question. Personally, I think it would be an extremely valuable addition to the international cricketing calendar, but I am not a cricket administrator.

319,T20 2020 World Cup Format,"So, the format of the World Cup is a Qualifying Stage, followed by a league stage with two groups of 6, then the Finals. Contributing to a total of 45 matches. I just think that it would have been better to have the format as a league stage with two groups of 7, followed by the Finals, which also gives a total of 45 matches.

Granted it would have reduced teams involved to 14 from 16 but it will give those qualifying a lot more matches with teams higher up, instead of just getting knocked out after 3 matches. Moreover, it also has the benefit of Money teams like India, England etc. having at least 6 assured matches instead of 5 which we know is a high priority for ICC.

The only benefit to current format I see is ICC being able to offer the empty platitude of having more associate nations involved (only 2 more than the 14 team format) even though they would actually be playing a qualifying stage first.

If he appeared to hit a slump, many prominent voices in cricket talked about taking care of his mindset. I am not trying to justify Khaleel by using Pant. I am talking about the management of youngsters. 

Even Harsha Bhogle brings up an interesting point about taking care of talented young players and preventing them from entering a downward spiral. Have a look at this video where he talks about helping out Prithvi Shaw at 2:59  [Harsha Bhogle's wish list for new BCCI Chief Sourav Ganguly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvf5QCY01Sc)

 I believe bowlers too need proper mentorship so they can succeed. We can't hang them out to dry whenever they perform poorly. Khaleel performed exceptionally well this IPL, he took 19 wickets in just 9 matches this IPL. He probably would have won the purple cap had he played more matches. SRH had some good people incharge to manage their players, like VVS, Mutiah Muralitharan and Tom Moody. Obviously, I understand that the IPL and International cricket are two different platforms. But the pressure and intensity during an IPL game can match upto that of most international matches.  I think Khaleel needs some help to succeed in International cricket. Kind of like the help that Dhoni provides. 

All I am saying is, Khaleel is just 21 years old and it would be terrible to write him off so early. The management needs to take care of him and groom him into a major asset.",Cricket,1572808670,Plugfix27,24,0,True,2019-11-03

Not sure if this question has been asked before, but I can't seem to find an answer anywhere online.

Its pretty well known that if you take a hit in the head, or even drop your helmet pretty hard, you should replace it because there could be damage that stops it from protecting your head as much as it could.

However, how long can you have a helmet before you should consider replacing it due to degradation of the material?

https://m.cricbuzz.com/cricket-commentary/23640/ind-c-vs-ind-b-final-deodhar-trophy-2019-20

India B (Playing XI): Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Baba Aparajith, Nitish Rana, Parthiv Patel(w/c), Kedar Jadhav, Vijay Shankar, Krishnappa Gowtham, Shahbaz Nadeem, Roosh Kalaria, Mohammed Siraj

India C (Playing XI): Shubman Gill(c), Mayank Agarwal, Priyam Garg, Virat Singh, Suryakumar Yadav, Dinesh Karthik(w), Axar Patel, Mayank Markande, Jalaj Saxena, Ishan Porel, Diwesh Pathania

 It’s the finals day in the Deodhar trophy. India A have been knocked out of the competition so the two remaining teams that will feature in the finals today are India C and India B. India C have by far been the best side in the competition. They have a potent opening pair in the form of Mayank Agarwal and Shubman Gill, their middle/lower order which consists of Dinesh Karthik, Suryakumar Yadav and Axar Patel have experience in abundance. And the quality of spinners in their line-up would make most international sides in the world envy. So, they will clearly start as favourites. They thumped India B by a massive margin in the dress rehearsal of the final. But the gap between the two sides isn’t as vast as that match suggested. India B would hope that they win the toss and bat first and put runs on the board. Remember, all the three matches have been won by teams batting first in this tournament. ",Cricket,1572837176,saltpepper90,23,72,True,2019-11-03

I need your help in somehow a critical situation am going through, as I am in a country where cricket is a dark area, nobody understand or know anything about the game, we are more of a football/basketball country, but now I have some workers from India and Bangladesh who work here in my country and I need to do something for them that will make them feel a bit closer to home and just to show them appreciation, what I need exactly is the following:

\- I will be organizing a tournament, where around 10-12 teams will participate, what I read and understood is that I need 11 players per team.

\- I have the venue as a football stadium, but how can I rearrange it for cricket?

\- First main issue, the equipment, what do I need per team? and how much do I need per match? and other than the kits can I get all teams use the same equipment during their matches?

\- Another issue is the rules, I already went and read as much as I could, but it's still kinda foggy for me, the rules because I need referees, how many do I need per match?

\- Finally, I want the shortest kind of matches (30 minutes or 60 per match or something similar) as I will have a format where all will be playing the most matches for more than a weekend.

Adding the sixth team gives great opportunity to the associate players, and also allows us to have three games running in parallel in each round. 

Each team would play one match each against the other five teams, either home or away. ROA home can be Nepal, or they can play their two home matches in two different locations (say Nepal and Oman). Points shall be awarded just like the WTC, with one-third points for a draw.

The entire tournament is essentially as long as a five test series would be. This can be organised in the the months of Nov-Dec-Jan. Ideally at the same time we could have 5 test long Ashes down under, WI touring one of NZL or SA, and Ireland and Zimbabwe touring the remaining southern hemisphere host.",Cricket,1572869234,SreesanthTakesIt,2,12,True,2019-11-04
448,"Open letter to MS Dhoni: Comeback Champ, they still need you","&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img oyuqwn3uzow31...*

 

We have seen your humility. We have witnessed your dedication for the team. You have exemplified sacrifice time and again. Your ‘everything else can wait’ when Ziva was born still reverberates in our ears. Memories of your sudden farewell from test cricket still pull up a frown on our faces. You have always placed country before everything else.

However, we fans have grown slightly wiser watching you captain all these years. We understand the ‘team cause’ that’s keep you away from the game. There might be pressure on you. Certain people in power may not want to see you play again. But oh dear captain, think once about us. We are not just your fans. We are India. And knowing the man you are you just can’t ignore your country’s call. And your country is screaming –come back champ, they still need you!

Your absence from the game has made cricket dull for millions. But we understand it’s just not the excuse that can bring you back. You have believed in logic all your life. You have finished games with thorough calculations. And probably now, you are putting the numbers together again. If our gut feeling is strong, we believe you are struggling to figure out the best possible move. This narration of giving youngsters chance has caught up with you too. But hey champ, every game is a national duty. And it shouldn’t be taken as an experiment. There are a billion heartbeats attached to every match. Nobody in the corridors of power has the right to deny us the joy of a win. And you don’t win games with experimentation.

The only criteria that should ever be considered while putting up an 11 is who are the best guys? Don’t you think captain you are compromising national duty by denying this team the best wicketkeeper-batsman in the country? How can you know for sure the thought process behind your absence from cricket is justified? How can you be sure you are not the best bet for the T20 world cup without giving it a shot? No dear Dhoni, you absolutely don’t have any right to deny your services to this country. If they say you can’t play, prove them wrong! You owe this to us.

Perhaps you haven’t followed cricket closely off late or maybe you have. It’s just impossible to predict you, one of those things we have grown used to in the ‘Mahillenium’. Just in the case you haven’t noticed, allow us to politely break this to you –not one guy has been able to cement his place in the role you used to perform effortlessly. In India’s match against Bangladesh, every minute your absence was felt. In those tumbling of wickets, in those faulty DRS calls and in the heart-breaking loss, you were missed Mahi. At one moment the crowd just went ‘Dhoni.. Dhoni..’.

Get back to playing sir. Prove it to us that you don’t have it anymore. This letter would probably never reach you but we fans are not as wise as you are captain. And if it does, you would probably laugh at us for doubting your judgment. But you can’t blame us champ. We have been waiting patiently series after series. We want our match winner back now. Come back already.

454,Playing T20 over 4 innings,"I dont understand why T20 has to be played in 2 innings where most of the teams elect to chase anyway because knowing the target improves your winning percentage massively. Isn't it more prudent to split the innings like test matches and play it in innings of 10 each. This alleviates the  target setting problem for the team batting first a bit and also ensures any change in conditions towards the latter half does not influence the game unduly. It would also help in rain influenced matches where if only 20 overs could be bowled, the matches could be decided by first innings alone.",Cricket,1572889886,pramodsk,39,10,True,2019-11-04
456,Australia vs Pakistan - 2nd T20I Probable Elevens,"Australia’s probable eleven looks to stay the same after they clean sweeper Pakistan’s Top Order and have them a massive run debt later on. This is what I believe, as a Pakistani, should be their eleven:

Babar Azam (C)
Imam-Ul-Haq
Fakhar Zaman
Haris Sohail
Mohammad Rizwan (WK)
Imad Wasim
Iftikhar Ahmed/Asif Ali
Shadab Khan
Wahab Riaz
Mohammad Amir
Musa Khan/Mohammed Hasnain

Imam-Ul-Haw plays with brains unlike Fakhar. He’ll take his time at the start but he will start striking once he’s familiar with conditions. Fakhar shouldn’t be out of the squad but he’ll sit so much better at three so he can adapt to conditions if Pakistan give them the start they need. Iftikhar can hit just as well as Asif however he’ll probably be picked over Asif as he can bike some off-spin as well. As we saw, Irfan was smashed all over the place and his evident and only inclusion in this squad was to utilise bouncers with the conditions which he made a mockery of. Musa Khan would be their wild card going into the second T20I providing pace and plenty of variation. This would be my perfect T20 team and I would believe that this team would have a high chance of beating Australia if a big total is made batting first.

15,Who are some lesser known express pace bowlers?,"Watching express pace bowlers or quality leg spinners is nearly always exciting and that got me thinking. 

There are a number of current players who can bowl in the high 140s/early 150s (87mph+) such as Archer, Ferguson, Gabriel, Bumrah etc, however I am curious about players who could bowl at these speeds though maybe weren't as famous or well known as others. 

An example of this is Andre Van Troost who represented Somerset and the Netherlands in the 90s. According to his Wikipedia page, he was described as making ""Waqar Younis look like a medium pacer by comparison"" by former England batsman Mark Butcher. 

I have some criteria for this. 

1. Players who may have only played a handful of international matches or maybe didn't even play internationals at all.

2. Must have been able to regularly bowl at the speeds listed above.

3. No famous faces who at their time of playing were known for being quick (such as Tyson, Holding, Tait etc.).

4. Current players are allowed though only if they are currently not on many peoples' radars.",Cricket,1571184336,Xoroshego,113,61,True,2019-10-15

Development of women's cricket should not be only with women getting better recognition but also better monetary aspects.

30,r/Cricket Selection Committee: Pick an Australian squad to tour India,"Hey guys. 

I, along with a group of friends, have made our own international schedule complete with batting and bowling rankings. We play international series (like the Ashes) of every team. This has been going on for a while now (since 2012), but we’ve only started keeping track of stats recently. 

Anyway, we are about to start the Australia’s tour of India, where they will play **2 tests and 3 T20is against Afghanistan**, and **3 tests and 2 T20is against India.** Problem is that we couldn’t decide the ideal Aussie squad for the tour. 

So, we came up with this idea: **r/cricket can decide the Australian squad.**

Some rules:

1. Squad has to be of 15-18 players for Tests and 13-15 players for T20is

2. Pick 1 Test squad and 1 T20i squad ONLY. 

3. You can decide the captain for each squad. 

4. No retired players 

5. Pick a squad that is best-suited for Indian conditions.  

6. When commenting the squads, please put the T20i and Test squads in separate comments. 

7. The most-upvoted comments for Tests and T20is will be the squad that is chosen.

Also, if any of you want to see the batting and bowling rankings, as well as the stats of your favourite players, let me know in the comments. It’s essentially CricketCaptain, except each match is actually played.",Cricket,1571205721,okaywhat22,30,13,True,2019-10-16

107,Why do fans take IPL so very seriously?,"Without meaning offense, in comparison to other domestic T20 tournaments, I've noticed people care a lot, sometimes too much imo abt the IPL..

Let's get the obvious out of the way : BCCI is rich, so IPL pays players more, BCCI has influence over ICC, so generally there are limited internationals clashing at the time and India doesn't necessarily play sport at home only in one season : so this is a period where no internationals clash for Indian players.

It's still though a domestic T20 tournament. It's played every year for just a month and half. And it's franchise cricket ! KKR for example has no obligation to play Bengal players, teams are starting to find an identity, but except a couple none really have it. And at the core of it - it's fancy cricket ! Kohli struggles with RCB captaincy and it doesn't matter coz his captaincy yields results when it matters when he leads the indian team.

Cricket unlike football, is more international driven than clubs.

Not to say, any other domestic T20 league is any better. BBL - it's just a fun day for the kids. Do we really care so much abt Melbourne Stars? No. They are there for the fancy stuff, a stress buster maybe from a difficult day at work? It's the same in England and would be with the 100..

It's only with IPL clubs fans though who'd be seen talking abt it all year around. Abt relegations and promotions. Abt how a MI-CSK rivalry is equivalent to a Man Utd - Liverpool one built over centuries..Abt not having international games but that instead. Isn't it a bit crazy? Who'd be available all year long from the overseas lot to play?

And at the core of it, cricket has and will be an international driven sport and not club driven, the direct opposite of football. You can't even begin to scratch the surface to get to the rivalry of say a North London Arsenal Tottenham derby with a BBL Melbourne Stars renegades clash. That's crazy.

The only major benefit I can see from these tournaments are - it's light, easy, I don't care much who wins loses but a beer and it's one relaxing evening.. and the fact WBBL and now English women T20s are spreading the women's game and making it popular, IPL too is taking baby steps there, which is good.

303,Sarfraz doesnt deserve this,"                             37 29 8 78.37%
Getting axed entirely from the Tests makes complete sense and a sane decision , neither results in team`s favor  nor personal performance for a long time , rightly deserved. However getting booted from the shortest format makes no sense . Not a single question was being raised on his own performance when it came to T20Is only because Pakistan were nothing less than invincible in the format since 2016 (stats in first line) , when Sarfraz became captain .Lets analyze his own stats in the format since 2016 , the year he became capt : 
         Mat   Inns   NO   Runs    HS        Avg          SR 
           45    32      10    663    89*     30.13      130.25 
Average and SR better than what his overall career stats are i.e 28 and 126 . Clearly showing his own performance didn`t dipped in the format unlike Tests and ODIs and rather improved by a small margin , yet he just not loses the captaincy , but also a place in the team after 4 consecutive losses which didn`t had your regular players part of the team for last 3 years and consisted of tried and tested players who the new coach and chief selector supported in his own tenure . Its utterly unfair to him and for the team. The funny part is he was being criticized for under-performing in the recent series against SL where he ended up as the highest run scorer from Pakistan. 
The T20 WC is exactly one year away from today , and our team which was so dominant for past 3 years was forcefully put through unnecessary changes which led to humiliating defeats against second string side that we changed a man who took your team from No.6 to No.1 in span of 3 years and has kept his side there for such a long period of time in a format where being consistent is almost improbable. His win percentage in T20Is is second best in history of T20i with at least 25 matches captained .

317,Post Match Thread: Vijay Hazare trophy group stage,"So the group stages of the premier List A tournament in India is done and the quarter finalists are decided. Rain wrecked havoc on the playing schedules and led to many games being rescheduled. A brief explainer of the format first - There are a total of 38 teams divided into 4 groups (and 3 classes). Groups A and B are the Elite division. Group C is also an Elite group, but not quite as Elite as A and B. Then there is the Plate group. Groups A and B have 9 teams each. Group C has 10 teams and Plate group the bottom 10. After the round robin stages, the top 5 from the combined Groups A and B, 2 from Group C and 1 from Plate make it to the QFs. The respective teams are Karnataka, Delhi, Punjab, Chattisgarh and Mumbai (defending champs). From Group C TN and Gujurat make the cut. Vinay Kumar's Pondi is the final team from Plate. 

Tamil Nadu are the team in form having won all 9 games in their group led by their top order batsmen Mukund and Baba Aprajit who made 450+ runs each. Big things were expected from Aprajith and maybe this is his season finally. Karnataka, having won the T20 tournament without losing a game, also had a near perfect group stage winning 8 out of 9 games. Captain Manish Pandey top scored with over 500 runs and 6 50+ scores (one 100, five 50s) at an average of 101. While the spotlight was on Karnataka opener KL having lost his test opening slot, it was the other opener, youngster Devdutt Padiakkal, who impressed with 456 runs including two centuries. This is only his second season and after a very impressive first season Karnataka might have unearthed another top order talent. KL didn't do too badly himself making 361 runs. Gujurat in Group C also won 8 out of their 9 games losing only to TN. The other spots however were decided only on the last day. All of Punjab, UP, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Chattisgarh were in the reckoning for four spots and positions on the table. Delhi, Punjab and Chattisgarh ended up on 22 points. Delhi finished above Punjab in lieu of their head to head result and CG ended up fourth with the lowest NRR (CG were in Group A, Punjab and Delhi in Group B so head to head did not apply to them, weird I know). Mumbai pipped UP for the last spot with a better NRR(once again Mum were in group A and UP in B, so no head to head result).

Other highlights in group stage include double centuries by Mumbai talent Yashasvi Jaiswal who ended up as the fourth highest run scorer with 504 runs in only 5 matches and just one run behind Pandey who played 8 games. Sanju Samson also made a double century and in typical Sanju Samson fashion, he made only one other fifty in the group stage. Just about half his runs came in one innings. Dhawan had a very quiet tournament making only 130 runs. 

There was hardly any breakthrough performances by the bowlers. Among the Elite groups, MP's Gaurav Yadav topped the wicket-takers list with 23 and was followed by Gujurat's RB Kalaria with 20. Punjab and India bowlers Sandeep Sharma and Sid Kaul picket 16 wickets each and were joined by Karnataka's Prasidh Krishna on 16. Our favourite millionaire Unadkat got 15 wickets from 8 games for Saurashtra.

The QFs are between

Karnataka vs Pondicherry,

Delhi vs Gujurat,

Punjab vs TN,

Mumbai vs Chattisgarh.

Karnataka start favourites in their QF but the others are a lot more closer to call. Delhi and Mumbai have both been patchy while Chattisgarh and Gujurat have been playing efficiently. CG have already beaten Mumbai once in the group stages and might fancy their chances again. TN have been on an absolute roll and you would back them to win over Punjab. Punjab don't really have a solid batting line up and the less said about TN's bowling, the better. This QF too looks interesting.",Cricket,1571442784,kpisagenius,10,80,True,2019-10-18

We play 25 overs a side, and so far played 4 games. Of that, 3 losses, and 1 abandoned match. 

I think it's our batting - scores of 107,62, and 70 all out is the main issue. Plus fielding, another 4 drops just now.

What goes in the making of this, is 

1. Gully cricket 
2. Kids of varying ages as participants
3. Morale issues

I don't know whether you appreciate Gully Cricket, but I'm sure you could relate to the mismatch of age group sports. Whenever there would be a great mismatch (+/- 5 years) among teenagers, the teams must necessarily redistribute players for the sake of balance. 

This gets especially difficult with the youngest kids. You want them to field (more often fetch the ball when carted off beyond the boundaries), but letting them bat is pain. Naturally, the greenhorns batted the first and lasted a little less than an over. 

The moment their furniture was disturbed, tears ensued. Wails that should have been recorded then and be played out to embarrass them. Instead, what those banshees summon are uncles/aunties. In the days of yore, employed men were allowed the luxury of sunsets. Unfortunately, we had to bear the brunt a social welfare. 

""Why are you guys so sour,"" he'd exclaim ""can't you bowl underarm or something!""

""This is seniors game. Why don't you bowl to the kid in the corner?"" we'd want to get hold of the bat while either the kid or the uncle were trying to keep us off.

""I've bowled you guys all your lives. Why can't you guys be nice to the kid?""

""That was a spin ball. Give us the bat.""

""What spin ball, if he can't play?""

""Remember this scar you gave me a few years ago. Here, take a look. Give us the bat.""

""Please understand, this is a kid. दूध-भात. (as in, the kid has ever had only Milk/rice in life). Don't kill his **morale** before he falls in love with the game.""

""But I'd lose the ball(over quota).""

""You amateurs, it's called a *Try-ball*. It's a ball with zero consequences.""

30,Umpire Performance October '18 to September '19,"Over the last few months, mainly during The Ashes and The World Cup, there have been lots of comments and posts on this sub criticising the standard of umpiring in international cricket. Unfortunately the ICC publishes no statistics of umpire performance, so much of the discussion has been based more on specific instances and general impressions rather than actual data. I thought it would be interesting to gather and analyse data on DRS reviews. Of course, performance on DRS reviews does not tell the whole story on umpiring standards, the vast majority of decisions that an umpire makes in the course of a match are not reviewed or even remotely questioned, but it is the only data we have.

Though it doesn't collate it anywhere that I could find, Cricinfo does fortunately record DRS review in the notes of their scorecards. I've manually been through and recorded the data against each umpire for the the last 12 months of test cricket. In that time, 43 tests with DRS in place were held. I chose to analyse just test matches, mainly due to the sheer number of ODIs (169 in the same period) and the fact there are normally more reviews per match in tests. 

In the period in question, 16 different umpires stood in between 1 and 7 tests each where DRS was in use. Ian Gould (Eng) umpired his final tests, retiring after the World Cup. Sundaram Ravi (Ind) was removed from the ICC Elite Panel along with Gould and has not stood in a test match since. Michael Gough (Eng) and Paul Wilson (WI) were added to the Elite Panel, increasing their presence in Tests. Ruchira Palliyaguruga (SL) and Paul Wilson (Aus) umpired their first tests.

The full data summary can be found at this link [https://i.imgur.com/YECqcN2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YECqcN2.jpg) but here are some of the highlights:

* Overall 243 reviews were struck down and 146 were overturned. That's a total umpire success rate of 62% which is less than I expected.
* Paul Wilson is the only umpire with no decisions overturned in this one year period, though he has umpired just one test. In his first test as umpire, he had 7 of his decisions reviewed and all were struck down (with just one 'umpire's call').
* Michael Gough has had a great start to his time on the Elite Panel. In his 5 tests in this period, he had 19 of his decisions reviewed, with only one overturned.
* The only other umpire with a success rate of 80% or better was Ian Gould who had just 3 decisions overturned out of 28 reviewed in his 7 tests.
* The umpire with the worst success rate is Nigel Llong with 7 correct decisions reviewed compared to 9 that were overturned in his 4 tests.
* Chris Gaffaney only did slightly better with 14 correct decisions with 16 overturned in his 6 tests.
* Rod Tucker was the umpire most trusted by players, with just three of his decisions reviewed per test on average.
* On the other hand, Joel Wilson was least trusted with 9.3 reviews per test.

Notes:

68,Rethinking Rohit's opening slot,"Well, now it's cast in stone that Rohit is going to open for all the 3 tests against South Africa. While the whole world is going gaga over Rohit's elevation in the batting order, I like to question his technique against the moving ball. 
He's been a phenomenal opened in white ball cricket where he's destroyed bowling attacks all over the world and has scored double hundreds for fun. But the fact of the matter is that the white ball doesn't move as much as the red ball does. I feel Rohit will be in all sorts of trouble when India tours the SENA countries. Also, the red ball doesn't move as much on home conditions so Rohit's place is safe for now but he's definitely not a long term option.
With Rohit opening in Tests for the foreseeable future, where does this put young Shubman Gill?
What about the domestic stars like Priyank Panchal and Abhimanyu Easwaran? And what about Prithvi Shaw when he's back from his doping ban?

India should definitely not go the way they went with Rishabh Pant. Pant was in the limited overs squad for the tour of the West Indies and never got a chance to prove himself. This was a time when he had a phenomenal domestic season and scores the fastest triple century in Ranji history.
While having a good bench strength is good, one must understand that if one person given the chance keeps doing well, the other person has to warm the bench and eventually get frustrated due to a lack of chances.",Cricket,1569938582,Srijan_2303,2,3,True,2019-10-01

3. All 120 wickets fell in the series.  
4. Only twice a score of 300 was breached.  
5. Philander, Rabada and Shami took 15 wickets each. Bumrah with 14.  
6. KL Rahul managed 30 runs in 2 tests while Pujara could only score 100 in 3 tests.

272,"“’The hundred’ is the Brexit of cricket. Unwanted, unnecessary, and poorly conceived.” Rant about the ECB’s ‘the hundred’ - Everything they have got wrong and why it will fail","Good afternoon chaps, this is going to be a long post regarding the hundred.  I would love to know everyone’s thoughts on what I have to say :)

I love cricket. I have spent countless hours watching it both on TV in love. I have spent immense amounts of time listening to TMS and watching the highlights. However, whoever has devised this rubbish should be out of a job.

Let’s firstly address whether or not a new competition is necessary in England.
The domestic calendar in English cricket is already very busy. The One Day Cup, the County Championship, and the T20 Blast ensure that there is plenty of cricket over the summer. This, I would argue that a new competition is not necessary. However, following the successes of the IPL and the Big Bash, I can definitely see the incentives for starting a franchise based T20 competition to run alongside the T20 Blast. The Big Bash in particular has been great in Australia for promoting cricket and expanding the game to a new audience. So for the sake of this thread let’s say that it is necessary to add to the existing domestic calendar.

However, the decision making by the ECB has been appalling, and to me, they have already wrecked what could have been a great advert for cricket in England. 
Firstly the format. I don’t even have words to describe how stupid it is. 10 ball overs bowled by two different players? What? Really? To me, and I’m sure a lot of other share this opinion, it’s just not cricket. I feel as if this alienates a lot of existing cricket fans who do not want to watch the game get destroyed by this shit. Also, the claim that a shorter game/new format will draw new grounds is a load of shit. It is literally more difficult to understand than normal cricket, and making a game 40 ball shorter is not going to attract anyone that T20 cricket doesn’t attract.


Secondly, how it is being broadcast. It’s true that there is not enough cricket on free TV in England. However the proposal for ‘the hundred’  is to ONLY HAVE 10 TELEVISED GAMES. What’s the point? It’s actually laughable how they’ve tried to brand it as a competition that everyone can watch when less than a third of the group games are free to watch. The beauty of the  it Bash is that tickets are cheap, and it is on free-to-air TV every night, so everyone can access it and it is always on so people can engage fully with it. ‘The hundred’ is a miserable attempt to recreate this. I don’t see it bringing new fans to cricket at all. It’s pathetic.

Thirdly, and one that they can still fix; the team names. I don’t really need to say more than “Manchester Originals”. I’m sorry what? Are they serious? Sort it out. These names sound like their off some sort of PlayStation game that doesn’t have licensing for actual team names.

Alternatively to ‘the hundred’, the ECB could just reform the T20 Blast. In my opinion, the T20 blast is great. Counties already have existing fanbases that would draw crowds and TV audiences if the ECB simply found a way to televise it on terrestrial TV (preferably BBC). I know some games are on Sky, but it’s expensive and therefore not everyone can watch it; moreover, not every game is on Sky, so I don’t see why the BBC/ITV/Channel 4/Channel 5 couldn’t televise the other games. This would get people to watch cricket - it would be easily accessible to everyone. The ECB could easily pump more money into the T20 Blast, or change the rules to allow more overseas players to play; with more world class players playing, bringing more viewers.

All in all, I don’t have high hopes for ‘the hundred’. Unfortunately I don’t think that it will be a complete flop, as I think people will go to the first couple of seasons just to “see what it’s like” rather than actually really enjoying the concept. The concept of a franchise-based competition is not what I’m opposed to, rather the dismal attempt at innovation from the ECB. T20 has been SO successful so I think straying away from this to a non-cricket version of cricket is ludicrous.

TLDR - ‘the hundred’ is going to be shite.

295,Looking for some information on cricket bat,"So, I bought in ""knocked in ready to play"" cricket bat from Kingsgrove a month back. Its Kingsport Deadly AG-63 model ($175 not the 3/400$ one). The thing this, even though I was said ""ready to play and fully knocked in"", I can see some ball marks on the anti-scuff sheets. 

I was wondering, if its just sort of a ""spot"" on the anti-scuff sheet rather than marks on the bat, or does this bat need more knocking in? 

**Note: the ""marks"" are visible when seen slanted (on a angle ) on light sources, not directly looking into the face of the bat.** 

Does anyone here have experience with ""fully knocked in bats"" from Kingsgrove before? 

This bat is not ""bad"", has nice grain distribution (10-11), has amazing sweet spot in the middle, but I feel, its is not performing at its best. The ping sounded amazing when I first bought it, and was hand picked by Harry (their experienced team), but its just feels like its lacking that ""stroke"".

In comparison, I absolutely struggle to see any televised domestic cricket from the UK. Forget the first class games - even the T20 blast isn't telecasted in entirety or at all here. 

And then you introduce a new format, rake in big names in Smith, Warner, etc - small tournament, 32 games and hearing even this won't be telecasted in entirety. Only 10 games on BBC.

328,In test cricket number 4 is the easiest position?,"On looking at any team line up, we see that number 4 batsman, whether Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, Faf du ,Babar Azam or even  Joe Root or Ben Stokes are surely ahead in terms of leading run scorers. 
The pattern here is that they all bat at number 4 or 5.
So, is number 4, the easiest batting position??
Because, the openers have to face new ball in the seaming conditions, also, if there's rain or little moisture in the surface, they are more prone to lose wickets. So, the openers and number 3 are quite challenging positions to bat on.
Talking about number 5 or 6, we see that these middle order batsman have to face the turning tracks if they are in the Asian conditions, and facing the confident spinners in the Asian conditions isn't easy which also makes them easy prey for spinners.
While number 7 doesn't has enough time to bat because of the lose wickets and also he has to work with tailenders to help the team to reach respectable total.

Thus, this easily concludes that number 4 is the easiest spot as he doesn't has to face seaming conditions, new ball or turners. We've also seen in the past about the batting legends like Tendulkar or Lara or Ponting.

421,This might have been discussed before but still I'm gonna go ahead and post this - What's the deal with Umpire's call?,"I was just watching India v. SA and the last wicket, an LBW appeal from R. Ashwin got overturned by DRS based on umpire's call. What is the deal with this? The hawk-eye clearly shows the ball was hitting the stumps and yet, the third umpire asks the field umpire to stick with this not out decision. Isn't that the whole reason why we have Third umpires? So that they can catch the minute factors which the field umpire might have failed to notice? This is basically saying - ""you know what? Your decision is basically wrong and the trajectory of the ball is clearly hitting the stumps. But the required percentage of the ball is not hitting the stumps so stick with your wrong decision"".

Let's assume that this is the foundation of the whole umpire's call. Why stop at ball hitting the stumps? Here is a scenario - The ball has nicked the bat and umpire has given not out. DRS shows the ball has microscopically edged the bat and hence is out. By the above logic, even that should be ruled not out based on umpire's call. But no then the decision is reversed. Why doesn't this qualify for umpire's call decision? Or am I missing something here?",Cricket,1570252727,vasishtsudhanva,7,1,True,2019-10-05

499,Why Pakistan is a slowly declining team.,"Now don’t get me wrong, I love Pakistan and I always will but their cricket team is just bad. Everyone says that they are amazing after winning the Champions Trophy but when you look at it now it’s was all a fluke. Pure luck only goes a certain distance and Pakistan went from No. 1 Test Team to now Number 7. After watching a terrible performance against Sri Lanka, I see how this Number 1 T20I Pakistan team is about to dip as well.

Misbah isn’t a bad coach; a bad team is what makes his job hard. After watching a few matches it hurts to see how reliant Pakistan are on Babar. If he goes, you’re done. Umar Akmal and Ahmed Shahzed should be lost forever and yet someone keeps bringing them back. Selection is poor with Imam being chosen over Abid and you all hate on Malik and Hafeez when really they’re the best we’ve got right now in all formats.

Pakistan has always been known for having the best bowlers in the world and yet as Mickey did say, it’s not our batting that’s bad, it’s our bowling. Hasnain can take hattricks but he can also give away 40 runs in a spell. Shadab can take wickets one game and he’ll throw it away the next by not using his brain at all. We lose Shaheen and Hasan to dengue fever and a back spasm respectively and we get given the inconsistency of Usman Khan Shinwari who Waqar Younis looks like he’s doing nothing with and yet... no matter how good our bowlers may be they just lack brains. They can’t bowl the correct line and length and against what they called a ‘B-Team’ Sri Lanka side they’ve suffered. A packed Gaddafi Stadium witness their worst loss in the recent times for Pakistan in T20s. 

Sarfaraz is trash.
I mean seriously he cannot bat so all you have him for is good capataincy and he’s worse at that. Give Babar a go and let him try because you can’t give Sarfaraz captaincy all because ‘He can speak English’. 

I’m embarrassed by what my country has become in terms of cricket. I’m praying they get their act together because I really wanna see them turn up and win the T20 World Cup. Yet they are far away.

As I said don’t take this in a bad way... there’s just so much wrong and nothing being done. Our country has some of the most passionate fans in the world. Gaddafi Stadium was packed with fans expecting their team to win and it was all put to waste.",Cricket,1570295372,Zain_ZK,13,0,True,2019-10-05

22,Best and Worst Conversion rates in Test Cricket - A new weighted measure [OC],"  I have used three ways to measure Conversion rates:

1. Standard rate (100s/ 50+ scores)

2. Dismissed 50s rate – Unbeaten 50s are not counted as it is not the batsman’s fault that he was unable to convert

3. Weighted Conversion rate based on position. (Will be discussed with more detail later)

I will only take batsman who scored at least 4 hundreds (316 players) as this shows the player is a genuine batsman and this is also the lowest number of hundreds where at least 1 fifty was scored. Data is correct as of 11 Sep 2019 (before Oval test)

**Best Conversion rate (100s/50s):**

1. JF Reid (6/2) = 75.0%

2. CAG Russell (5/2) = 71.4%

3. DG Bradman (29/13) = 69.05%

4. GA Headley (10/5) = 66.7%

5. JHW Fingleton (5/3) = 62.5%

6. S Dhawan (7/5) = 58.3%

7. VG Kambli (4/3) = 57.1%

8. A Melville (4/3) = 57.1%

9. CP Mead (4/3) = 57.1%

10. MJ North (5/4) = 55.6%

**Selected others in Top 50**

15. V Kohli (25/22) = 53.2%

21. SPD Smith (26/26) = 50%

42. CA Pujara (18/20) = 47.4%

&amp;#x200B;

**Worst Conversion rate (100s/50s):**

1. A Ranatunga (4/38) = 9.5%

2. MV Boucher (5/35) = 12.5%

3. APE Knott (5/30) = 14.3%

4. SR Watson (4/24) = 14.3%

5. MS Dhoni (6/33) = 15.4%

6. IA Healy (4/22) = 15.4%

7. A Flintoff (5/26) = 16.1%

8. SP Fleming (9/46) = 16.4%

9. Shakib al Hasan (5/24) = 17.2%

10. MH Richardson (4/19) = 17.4%

**Selected others in Top 50**

16. Q de Kock (4/17) = 19.05%

24. AD Mathews (9/34) = 20.9%

31. JM Bairstow (6/21) = 22.22%

42. Mushfiqur Rahim (6/19) = 24.0%

&amp;#x200B;

The Best converters are generally top order batsmen, who have scored under ten hundreds (the Don not included obviously). The worst converters are generally lower order batsmen, and wicketkeepers make up 5 of the top 6.

The Dismissed rate will be very similar to the normal rate because unbeaten 50s generally make a small proportion of fifties.

**Best Conversion rate (100s/50s):**

1. JF Reid (6/2) = 75.0%

2. DG Bradman (29/11) = 72.5%

3. AC Voges (5/2) = 71.4%

4. CAG Russell (5/2) = 71.4%

5. GA Headley (10/5) = 66.7%

6. CA Davis (4/2) = 66.7%

7. JHW Fingleton (5/3) = 62.5%

8. WH Ponsford (7/5) = 58.3%

9. S Dhawan (7/5) = 58.3%

10. AG Prince (11/8) = 57.9%

&amp;#x200B;

**Worst Conversion rate (100s/50s):**

1. A Ranatunga (4/36) = 10.0%

2. MV Boucher (5/31) = 13.9%

3. SR Watson (4/23) = 14.8%

4. A Flintoff (5/25) = 16.7%

5. APE Knott (5/24) = 17.2%

6. IA Healy (4/18) = 18.2%

7. MH Richardson (4/18) = 18.2%

8. SL Campbell (4/18) = 18.2%

9. SP Fleming (9/40) = 18.4%

10. Q de Kock (4/17) = 19.1%

There is minimal movement in these rankings. The Don moves up to second, Voges, Mr. Unbeaten, comes in at three, and in the second rankings QdK moves into the top ten. This second measure is more useful in measuring conversion rates without being very transformative on the standard rate, and so is a good measure to help create the third weighted measure.

The third measure is based on position. Take this [graph here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/d3sxve/conversion_rate_in_test_cricket_by_position_as_of/). It shows that one, converting fifties becomes more difficult as you move down the order, and two, confirms that the first and second measures are very similar. So, this begs the question, who has the best/ worst conversion rate based on position. 

The way I measured is the same as in [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/ckc16h/the_greatest_not_out_batsman_in_test_cricket/), but I will explain this again. Take Brendon McCullum, who played in many positions throughout his career. At 5, he scored 5 hundreds and 5 dismissed fifties, which gives a conversion rate of 50%. If you were to divide this by the average conversion rate at 5 (33.55%), this gives 1.49 which is how much better his conversion rate compared to the average. Then take 1.49 and multiply by (beaten 50+ scores at 5/total beaten 50+ scores), which gives a weighting to the value. So 1.49 x (10/40) = 0.375. If you do this for all the positions he batted and sum all the weighted values, it gives 1.11. This shows that given the positions he batted, McCullum has a conversion rate which 1.11x better (or 11% better) than the average batsmen who were to score the same number of 50+ scores in those positions, and so we can now more accurately compare conversion rates of lower order batsmen and batsmen up the order.

For this measure, I will only take batsmen with 10+ hundreds. This is because they have scored a large enough number of 50+ scores, where unbeaten 50s (or lack of for my measure) will not have a large bearing. Plus we will be able to see a higher proportion of true batsmen.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a better look at conversion rates, because you can compare batsmen from all over the order, and yet there is still one man who refuses to be usurped from the top. Bradmans conversion rate is double what you would expect the average batsman to be which is just astonishing. Gilchrist also had an incredible conversion rate considering he batted at 7. There are 5 top Australians in the top 10… while there are 4 England players in the bottom ten, with Joe Root at second place. It is also pretty incredible that Smith and Kohli are so so close to each other.

This is the best way to compare conversion rates, yet it must be stated that there are numerous occasions where lower order batsmen hit out when batting with the tail, so this is certainly not a 100% accurate measure.

26,England's individual records under Trevor Bayliss,"I imagine in the next few weeks there will be loads written about Trevor Bayliss' England reign and all the highlights and lowlights.

I think this does a decent job of showing the failure of England under Bayliss to find consistent top order players. Further down the list are the likes of Hales, Vince, Stoneman and Westley. All averaged in the 20s with no hundreds between them. Even Burns and Denly who have probably done enough to get on the winter tours this year are still averaging in the 20s in Tests. The only other batsmen who average over 30 in Tests under Bayliss are Hameed (43.80) and Foakes (41.50).

As opposed to the batsmen, Bayliss has been blessed by the fact he has had a very consistent and largely effective bowling attack. The only other seam bowlers to be picked were Sam Curran, Roland-Jones, Craig Overton, Ball, Stone and Tom Curran. Of those only Sam Curran played more than four tests (21 wickets at 29.00). Mark Wood is an interesting/sad case here as he made his debut in the New Zealand series before Bayliss took up the job and his last Test was in the West Indies this year, but has only played 11 matches in those four years.

Bayliss has overseen the growth of England's ODI batting to the point where Root, Roy, Morgan, Bairstow, Buttler and Stokes could arguably be in England's top ten all time ODI batsmen. With the consistency of England's top six it has been hard for anyone else to get an extended run in the team. Only two other batsman have played more than ten games, Vince (265 runs at 24.09) and Billings (181 runs at 22.62). The next highest runscorer is James Taylor (395 runs at 56.42) who played his last match in 2015. It will be interesting to see which batsman can break into England's XI over the next four years. They have probably moved on from Hales, Vince and Billings and so perhaps the next coach will give a debut to someone like Sam Hain or Tom Banton?

England's bowling in ODI's has been far more ropey than the batting. I think part of this is due to playing largely on incredibly flat pitches at home. The world cup quintet of Archer, Wood, Woakes, Plunkett, Rashid was one of the most effective bowling attacks of the tournament so that bodes well. These stats go quite a way to demonstrating how underrated Adil Rashid has been in England's rise to world number 1 and world champions. Also, Moeen Ali's role in the team as a bowler is bizarre because his ability to get through ten cheap middle overs has been very useful, but he is clearly not in the side to take regular wickets.",Cricket,1568576428,j913r,12,35,True,2019-09-15

First of all, limited overs cricket was supposedly ""invented"" in the mid 20th century, an assertion I find to be extremely questionable since it is the most logical format for a game - one side bats then the other tries to beat the score, game over. Shouldn't this be the standard format when developing the game? 

But supposing this is true, then how did club cricketers play the game for 100 plus years before limited overs cricket? Were they all 3, 4 or 5 day games? When did they work? How did they get young kids to play cricket for that long? It's doing my head in!

61,Players to watch in the Australian domestic summer,"There are a lot of question marks over the team in all three formats this summer. Can't overstate how excited I am for the domestic season to begin. Thought I'd put together a list of the more overlooked players I'll be watching most closely this summer - there'll be more than enough written about the likes of Pucovski, Burns, and Renshaw.

**Nic Maddinson**

Once almost as big a target of public vitriol as Mitch Marsh, Maddinson last season bounced back remarkably from being dropped from the NSW contract list to make 563 runs in 8 innings for Victoria, with three hundreds (no one made more in the season, despite some having played 20 innings). He showed his versatility as an opener as well as a middle order batsman.

**Sam Whiteman**

Once Australia's brightest wicketkeeping hope, Whiteman made a return to the WA side towards the end of the last Shield season as a specialist opener after a horrific run of finger injuries. Probably won't do much keeping since Inglis has made himself the first-choice gloveman, but is an extremely talented batsman.

**Ben McDermott**

I've said this for a long time but I think McDermott is a potential three-format player for Australia. He's yet to have a breakthrough season in the long form but has been an excellent performer for the Hurricanes and Tasmania's one day side for a couple of seasons. He's got a real technique, too, and made 5(98)* in a match-saving rearguard last season. At 24, I'm hoping 2019/20 is his year.

**Riley Meredith**

Warnie memes aside, Meredith is improving constantly and has begun to add accuracy and movement to his raw pace, which has been a big post for a Tasmanian side that has traditionally relied more on accurate medium pace. Really impressive durability for a young express fast bowler too. At 23 I see a big future for him, could complement J. Richardson well as an enforcer in years to come.

**Will Sutherland**

Burst onto the scene last season in Victoria's one-day side and troubled batsmen with his height and speed. Apparently can bat too. Just 19 years old. I can imagine him being a very useful 7/8 in the ODI side. This one's pretty speculative but I loved what I saw from him.

**Glenn Maxwell**

**Warner/Khawaja** \- Either or. No other genuine options stepping up right now...  


**Burns -** First opener picked. Selectors need to stop fucking around and get him in.  


**Pucovski -** It's his time. Pick him at 3 and keep him there for the next decade. He is, and will be, a star.  


**Smith -** Love u bby  


**Labuschagne -** His future is at 5. With Pucovski at 3 and Smith at 4, batting him in the middle order will relieve some of the pressure on him. He's already flourishing with the pressure he's had coming in so early in the Ashes. He reminds me off Hussey and could be a great anchor.  


**Patterson/Head -** 6 has always plagued Australia. Just pick whoever is in form. But I do like Travis Head.  


**Paine (wk c) -** Not going anywhere at this stage.

73,Post Ashes Analysis thread (Australia),"Thought it might be good to have a post-series thread for the Aussies to dissect our performances.

Overall, very happy to retain the Ashes. While not as sweet as winning the series, given the team we have and the year we've had, I think this is an outstanding performance. I would argue every side we've brought over here since 2001 is considerably better than this one on paper, so I suppose we are lucky that this English side is an absolute mess. 

**Highlights:**

* Steve Smith. Nuff' Said. 
* Game plans  -  From a bowling perspective, this series was a huge success. Cummins and Hazelwood were outstanding but I am just very proud of our think-tank for accepting that our normal blueprint for bowling would not work in England. We definitely showed we learned from the mistakes of 2015 by coming here with a more nuanced and considered approach to bowling. The selections of Siddle and Pattinson were absolutely the right call, although I admit both under-whelmed overall, and I did expect better. Bodes well for Australia that we are willing to look past 'The Australian Way' to win overseas. 
* Labuschagne  - Showed immense grit and application. While his conversion is an issue, it would be churlish to criticise him for in it in a series were the ball dominated the bat so heavily. His leg spin is also very useful and should come in handy on certain wickets. 
* Preparation -  While our batting failed to impress as a whole (more on that later) at least we gave our batsman the best possible chance to succeed. Holding a preceding A tour was brilliant, as was the inter-Australia match, and kudos to the young players who came over to play in county cricket. Using the Dukes ball in Australia is also a commendable initiative. 

**Selections**

Squad -  Close to the best squad available. I do not agree with Burns and Patterson's commissions, but at least we were given clear reasons  (health and recent form respectively). Not everyone will always agree with selections, the best we can hope for is transparency. However, it doesn't take hindsight to say Burns should have been in this squad and I think we all called that. 

Team selections started off really well, we left out Starc for Patto and Sids because we thought they could execute our game plan better, and that was proven to be the right call. Leaving out Hazelwood seems like a mistake but it appears that he wasn't quite game ready, so kudos there. Selecting Wade was an absolute must, if guys can't get picked after dominated shield and A tours, then it really sends the wrong message. He had a middling series at best, and his hundred has probably saved his career, but whatever you think of the bloke he HAD to be selected. Whether he keeps his spot is another point entirely

It's easy in hindsight, but our selections got progressively worse as the series went on. A lot of what I am about to say is really easy in hindsight, so take it with a grain of salt.

* Picking Siddle and M Marsh was nonsensical. The idea of Marsh was that he could shoulder the bowling load, so why then would we pick a workhorse over Patto? Sids did bowl well in this series before this test so I understand it, but it seems we were a bit too conservative
* Dropping Bancroft after two tests -  While his technique isn't much better than Harris, he is a much better fielder and at least showed some real grit. Added benefit of being right handed against Broad  (Did he get any right hand wickets?!)
* Sticking with Warner over Khawaja -  Huge double standards. Warner has much more credit in the bank then Khawaja it is true, but his away record is just as abysmal. Khawaja at least got set and looked decent while at the crease, even if he threw it away. Davey looked like a walking wicket from the second test onwards. Hard to be critical of the selectors when he has a much better record than Ussie but this one really grates.

188,About Steve Smith's batting,"Smith has had a fantastic Ashes, but there's something that's I've been pondering for a while about the way that he bats. We know that him walking across his stumps is to compliment his strength on the leg side and stop himself nicking it behind as easily. If someone bowls a straight one at him, he usually tucks it to the leg side and rules lbw out of the equation.

The thing about this is that his batting depends a lot on his hand-eye coordination (unlike the other members of the Fab 4 who depend more on their balance, and more conventional technique that is likely to give them longevity.)This will obviously start to deteriorate as he gets older and affect his approach, making him far more likely to miss his tuck to the leg side and get out lbw. I wonder whether his batting technique will become more orthodox as the years go on to counter it, because I'm sure that he'll find some way.

2.) Chris Woakes will not play more than another 10 test matches for England 

3.) Foakes will be played, average low 30s and be dropped again

4.) Ali will not be recalled to the Test team

5.) Root will prove to be an excellent England captain by the time his career ends

Australia:

1.) This represents peak Steve Smith, and a future loss in form will see his average revert back towards “other” great modern players (I.e around Ponting, Tendulkar - but not noticeably better than them) 

2.) Warner will recover his form and hit at least another 10 test centuries

I originally stopped due to my P.E teacher telling me that I would never make the team or be successful. However, 5 years on I'm ready to give it another go! So are they're any tips or advice for a returning player? All responses are much appreciated :)

204,Post - Ashes camaraderie is brilliant and reminds me of the good old Indo-Pak days.,"The images coming out after an exciting and close test series in the '19 Ashes finished have been lovely to see. 2 cricketing rivals who gave it their all, ended the series as they should have - neither losing the series outright. Hard test cricket and post that getting together for a beer, all of them, the leech and Smith pics. What cricket is all about. Rivals on the field but nothing personal off it. 

And it makes me reminiscent of the India Pakistan bilaterals from years gone by. India-Pakistan are much more than cricket rivals, I know, but just speaking of their cricketing rivalry in the 80s and 90s that was something, innit? And off the field a lot of reports came out of their interactions. Shoaib Akhtar early 00s was hugely popular in the Indian camp. Inzi's humble nature stories and him bringing his daughter to get Sachin's autographs when he was practicing. Sachin's popularity with the Pakistani squad entirely. And then pop them on the field. Akram, Younis, Shoaib vs Dravid Tendulkar Ganguly. 

Indo-Pak bilaterals if they were happening today would prolly be routs bases on where the Indian team is, and where Pakistan is. And remembering the Aussie routs over England in the 90s it doesn't make for pleasant neutral watching. 

I understand why the two countries don't play bilaterals anymore but one still reminiscences when they did, even the Pathan hattrick, and Pak nearly chasing down 350 in 2004. Can't help wonder how the games between the two would go down and relationships and camaraderie off it. And Pak did surprise India in the CT final. Would have been fantastic to see them play more regularly, though I'll repeat this again before people jump on it, I understand why they don't. It's just sad that they don't.",Cricket,1568681042,AussieCricFan,22,63,True,2019-09-16

From his answers and the way he approached the interview with a sense of honesty does not regret speaking up about things he went wrong, does not fully regret messaging south African players stating there his mates etc. Very basic very simple KP interviews reviewing the highs and lows of his career.

I grew watching KP and fell in love with how he approached the game the no fear basis of cricket a very Australian approach similar to Gilchrist and Hayden, take the attack on regardless of who was bowling. Very much admitted this approach did let him down at times and may have ruined his averages but essentially it made him who he was. As Vaughan stated in the series that Kevin Pietersen would not have been half as entertaining or the player he was if he stuck in and played for averages. 

Swann and I guess many of the England players at the time have a grudge on KP and rightly so he was not easy to manage in the changing room didnt really get on with many people and textgate was essentially a turning point in relationships with the senior players. But at the end of the day there should have been a better resolve for this and should not have ended the way it did in 13-14.

Kevin Pietersen career came to an abrupt end, it should have lasted another year or 2 where he could have broken the 10000 run landmark and played at 4 for England for as long as he could. Kevin Pietersen was an immense talent who was motivated by his ego and personality.

325,Tim Paine - “Ashes retaining captain” - how much credit does he deserve really?,"Reading some of the wrap ups from the series, it’s annoyed me to see how much credit Paine has got simply for being the nominal captain of a side that has retained the Ashes. If you look at his actual performance in the games that Australia won and lost - I’d argue that he had next to nothing to do with the Australian wins, but can be fairly directly blamed for the Australian losses. I’d say Smith (and to a lesser extent the Australian bowlers) are almost solely responsible for the matches Australia won, and it’s no coincidence that when Smith didn’t play or for once failed to hit 50, Australia lost. The game he played half of was fittingly only good enough for a draw

Australian wins: Total match runs
1st test:
Smith: 286
Paine: 39

4th test:
Smith: 293 
Paine: 81

Australian losses:
3rd test:
Smith: Did not play - concussion
Paine: 11 runs
One of the deciding factors: Paine’s DRS mistake*

5th test:
Smith: 103 runs
Paine: 22 runs
One of the deciding factors: Paine’s decision to bowl first*

In conclusion, I’d argue Smith gave Australia two Ashes wins, Paine zero, and that Paine had a big role in both losses with key captaincy mistakes and failing with the bat. Let’s stop giving him so much credit for retaining the Ashes.",Cricket,1568778562,Plopsack,11,0,True,2019-09-17

##### 1. [1st Test, England tour of West Indies at Kingston, Feb 24 - Mar 1 1990](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/16616/scorecard/63526/west-indies-vs-england-1st-test-england-tour-of-west-indies-1989-90)

Considered one of the greatest upsets of it's time this is a game I hadn't heard about till made it's way to the top in this list. This game was apparently the first game of test cricket ever shown on Sky TV. It was the first win by England against a West Indian team in the West Indies since Trinidad in 1973-74, after which they had lost 20 and drawn nine Tests. A key reason this game is ranked as the greatest upset is due to England's *terrible* record leading into the match, they had managed a sole win in the last 25 games (across three years), while the West Indies were performing at their peak, having lost a single test at home (out of 30) in the last decade.

West Indies won the toss and chose to bat, with the openers making 62 runs. England were going for a back to basics approach and their disciplined outside-off-stump bowling saw West Indies collapse to 164 all-out. Fraser has innings figures of 20-8-28-5, a single spell being *five for six*. However the English batsmen still had to face a bowling attack of **Malcolm Marshall, Ian Bishop, Courtney Walsh and Patrick Patterson**. In proud English tradition two South Africans stood up, Vice- captain Allen Lamb and Robin Smith, added 172 for the 4th wicket. Lamb made this 10th test century, 5th against West Indies and with some help from keeper Russell England stretched out to 364, a solid lead of 200. 

The West Indies came into the second innings with far more application, however the damage had been done. With the dismissal of Viv Richards at 192-5 a win for England was sealed. At close of day 3 West Indies found themselves at 229-8 with Marshall and Walsh at the crease. Heavy rain on the rest day and on day 4 delayed the result to day 5, with the West Indies dismissed for 240. England chased the 41 runs down in just over 16 overs. 

The result was most notably for the clinical nature in which England bested the dominant home team. Of course the West Indians bounced back to win the series 2-1 however the Kingston win marked a significant aberration in the status quo of test cricket.

Notes: Was the Test match debut of Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain.

##### 2. [2nd Test, Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka at Colombo (PSS), Mar 15-19 2017](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/11019/scorecard/1083445/sri-lanka-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-sl-v-bdesh-2016-17)

This away victory for Bangladesh the highest place of their four entries on the top 20 list, most by any team. Expectedly so, as the previously decade of Bangladesh cricket has been flashes of brilliance followed by periods of steady, slow, upward growth. This win was on the back of excellent performances from Bangladesh's top current generation players. The previous match on the series saw Sri Lanka win in commanding fashion, where centuries from Kusal Mendis and WU Tharanga ensured 259 run win. Soon after the Mahmudullah was dropped as a result of pressure from the BCB president. If not for Liton Das's injury indications where that captain, Mushfiqur Rahim, would be dropped too. 

Sri Lanka won the toss and set a strong first innings score of 338 on the back of Chandimal's 138, who stitched two 50 runs partnerships for the 8th and 9th wickets. Bangladesh's reply began well with a 95 run opening stand, at 192 twin strikes from Lakshan Sandakan, the left-arm chinaman Bangladesh were notorious for not being able to pick, and a follow-up wicket from Lakmal saw them slip to 214-5 at the end of day 2. Still 124 runs behind Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan mounted a 92 run partnership on day 3, after Rahim's dismissal the debutant, Mosaddek Hossain, walked in. His 131 run partnership saw Shakib to a fine century, 116, and at one point they were 420-6 before Herath cleaned up the tail ending up with figures of 34.1-6-82-4. 

Sri Lanka in reply begin well, a partnership between Karunaratne and Mendis added 86 before Shakib and Mustafizur Rahman took 2 each to leave Sri Lanka six down, with a mere 61 run lead. Karunaratne played well for his 126 before he too feel to Shakib Al Hasan. In MDK Perera bailed Sri Lanka out with a 80 run partnership with Lakmal for 9th wicket,  eventually leaving 191 runs to defend. Though a modest total this would be no easy run chase, Sri Lanka had previously defended fewer against India in 2015. Spin opened from both ends, the obvious choice for this fifth day minefield, Hearth and Perera would end up bowling 47 of the 58 overs bowled. In the 8th over Hearth get 2 in 2, leaving Bangladesh 22-2, after which Tamim Iqbal played what is probably the one best 4th innings chases in Asia this decade. He was denied the century he well deserved, falling for 82 however the damage was done. Regular strikes from Sri Lanka couldn't do much to prevent a famous victory for Bangladesh, playing their 100th test. Just to mark the significance of Tamim Iqbal's innings, Shakib Al Hasan had taken 6 wickets scored the innings saving 116 however Iqbal was awarded Man of the Match for scores of 49 and 82.

Notes: Herath completed 1000 First Class wickets on day 5, also this 39th birthday.

##### 3. [2nd Test, South Africa tour of Australia at Melbourne, Dec 24-30 1952](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17454/scorecard/62747/australia-vs-south-africa-2nd-test-south-africa-tour-of-australia-1952-53)

HJ Tayfield maybe a name with which you are familiar but can't place. His bowling performace (off-spin), 9 for 113 against England at Johannesburg in '56-'57, ranks as the [best bowling figures of the 20th century](http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2001/jul/30bow100.htm). However Tayfield appears once again on that list, at 50th place is his 7 for 81 in the second innings of this game. Tayfield's combined match figures of 66-22-165-13 led the way for South Africa's first victory over Australia for forty-two years. 

In the first innings South African got 227, from a reargarde effort by all-rounder Anton Murray; Richie Benaud ended the innings picking up 2 wickets in his 6 overs. Tayfield bowled an unchanged four hour spell marked by his signature consistent line-and-length, taking key wickets along with leg-spinner PNF Mansell. Australia managed only 243, in reply South Africa made 388 on the back of an excellent 162* by WR Endean; Australia's star all-rounder Keith Miller had troubled batsmen early but was removed from the attack on account of sore feet allowing the top- order to settle. Chasing 373 the home team managed 290, with the entire middle-order falling to Tayfield's off-spin. 

By all accounts this South African team should not have troubled Australia at home, it was only the combination of strong individual performaces and overall *excellent* fielding that they won, this win in turn set-up their win in the 5th test leading to a drawn series. 

Notes: Miller completed Test double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets.

374,'Maalis' Have Become Curators Now and That is the System's Biggest Achievement: Daljit Singh," Curator Daljit Singh has retired a happy man after 22 years of service to Indian cricket. They are no longer seen as ""maalis"" and are getting due respect, a change that pleases him the most.

Daljit, a former first-class cricketer, may not be involved in the BCCI's pitch committee anymore but it is still difficult to keep him away from the 22-yard strip.

He continues to head the Punjab Cricket Association pitch committee and is overseeing preparations for the second T20 International between India and South Africa here on Wednesday. It is hot and humid even for the players but it doesn't bother Daljit one bit.

""I still exercise. I got to if I have to stand under the sun,"" said Daljit who resigned as BCCI's chief curator earlier this month.

Former PCA and BCCI president I.S Bindra handpicked him to produce the fastest pitch in India at Mohali back in 1993 and in another four years, Daljit became part of BCCI's first pitch committee in 1997.

""Needless to say Indian cricket has come a long way including the job of a curator. Back in the day groundsmen were merely seen as 'maalis' (gardeners) who didn't even get paid but now we have a system in place which produces certified curators (since 2012).

""Like umpires, curators are also posted now,"" he said, referring to BCCI's four-level certification course which groundsmen have to pass to become curators.

As of now, around 100 BCCI certified curators are working across the country.

""It is a big number. I leave behind a settled system. The credit must go to the board also. BCCI in many ways was a trend-setter, it gave us the best possible resources to prepare good pitches. The likes of Bindra, Jagmohan Dalmiya and Sharad Pawar listened to us.""

The job of a curator is a thankless one, especially in India, where intense discussions over the nature of the pitch are normal ahead of an international game.

More often that not, pressure is exerted by the home side to prepare a pitch of its liking.

""You can't say interference, they have their interests, why not?"" asks Daljit.

""The home team takes interest and there is nothing wrong in that. It is like that all over the world. Curator must realise there is a match referee. If you go overboard, you could get a poor rating. There must be a balance between bat and ball.""

And he too was accused of going ""overboard"" in certain cases, most infamously in the 2009 game between India and Sri Lanka in Delhi where the game was abandoned due to a ""dangerous pitch"". The entire BCCI committee, including Daljit, was sacked following the incident. He was later reinstated.

""There was an inquiry conducted by the ICC and its then curator Andy Atkinson had come to Delhi. He prepared the report which stated that the BCCI curators were not at fault. The DDCA was undergoing renovation at that time and I had warned them against the lack of time to prepare a suitable pitch but they did not pay heed to it,"" he recalled.

More recently, in 2017, Daljit received flak for preparing a rank turner for the India-Australia Test series opener in Pune where the hosts suffered a massive 333-run defeat with the match getting over well inside three days.

The pitch was expectedly rated poor by the ICC and it was a rare loss for India at home. Daljit said there is nothing wrong in preparing turning tracks and that game was a one-off.

""It is fair enough. They also prepare to their needs when we travel. Ideally the pitch should seam on day one, helps the batting side on day two and three and after that spinners come into play.

""Having said that, like you and me, pitches also age. It also depends a lot on what time of the year you are conducting the game, the pitch will behave accordingly. This time in North, Ranji Trophy will be played in December and I expect the fast bowlers to have a good time.""

Having played the game for decades before becoming a curator, Daljit always has a bagful of stories to tell. He likes the understanding between India captain Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri.

""The captain runs the show and it is best that coaches work behind scenes,"" said Daljit who extensively worked with Karnataka legends Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, Sunil Joshi, Javagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad, Dodda Ganesh and Sujit Somasunder when he was working for a company in Bangalore.

""The great G R Viwanath spotted me in a market and told me to work with the players. They all went on to play for India but when I met them first they were not great athletes. I remember I could beat Anil in a sprint. But through sheer hardwork he rose to the top and many other Karnataka players of that era also shone.""",Cricket,1568809235,SignalBoat,0,19,True,2019-09-18

412,I created an All-time XII with one player from each test team. Try it yourself in the comments.,"[I don’t know if this has been done before on here; I’ve been around a while and I can’t remember, so I did a search, but nothing came up; sorry in advance if this is well-trodden ground.]
Despite seeming like a simple task, this was actually harder than it looks; I realised right-off-the-bat that I couldn’t simply pick whomever I think were the best players from each test-playing board, because I would probably end up with a team which didn’t have players filling all the appropriate positions (e.g. too many number 3s/4s, not enough openers, no wicket-keeper, not a very good bowling composition). After taking this into consideration, I had to ensure that I balanced filling rolls with picking players that represented their nation as genuine world-class players. I ended up with something that I am pretty happy with (although I am still unsure of some of it), and I wanted to share this with you guys, as I know you all have very strong opinions, and I really want to read your views; and it would be interesting to see if people from other countries (I’m English), think about players very differently. Anyway, I’ve given my reasoning for selecting the players, just in case you’re interested.
1) SUNIL GAVASKAR (India): One of the greatest openers the world has ever seen, and in my opinion the best batsman that India has ever produced. I don’t know how he is viewed in India, but from an English perspective, this guy is criminally underrated. Personally, I would say that he is a tiny bit better than Tendulkar, given how much harder it is opening the batting, the fact that Sunny G played against some of the best bowling attacks of all-time (Looking at you, West Indies), and had fewer minnows to beat-up. I know Tendulkar is beloved in India, and this is not disrespect to a great player, so please don’t hurt me.
2) HERBERT SUTCLIFFE (England): As an Englishman, I must admit that it would be tricky to pick any player that I have ever watched as all-time great. Certainly, Pietersen and Cook were great batsmen, but they don’t belong here; Anderson as a bowler, maybe, but I still think he pales in comparison to the West-Indian pacers of the 70s and 80s. However, when talking with older members of my family, it becomes clear that players like Sutcliffe, Hobbs, and Hammond were phenomenal cricket players. I can only look at statistics, but they certainly back them up. From doing research it seems clear to me that Sutcliffe may have been the best opener in history, so as an Englishman, I’ll take that.
3) DON BRADMAN (Australia): Who else? Probably the easiest pick of the lot. The only issue is that Hayden, Smith, Warne, Gilchrist, McGrath, and many others that have tormented my country for so long must be omitted. Aussies, you don’t know how lucky you are.
4) KUMAR SANGAKKARA, Captain (Sri Lanka): It was a toss-up between choosing Murali and Williamson, or Hadlee and Sanga. I went with the latter because I find it hard to choose a current player from a team with so much history, and because I think Sangakkara was the best batsman of his era, pure and simple. It was a pleasure to watch him bat, every shot effortless and elegant, and the runs just kept coming. A magnificent player and a fine captain, during what was a golden era of cricket in Sri Lanka. Even now, in his early-forties, I reckon he could still put on his cricket whites and destroy the worlds best bowling attacks. I’ve chosen him as captain, because unlike many players, the captaincy did not burden him, if anything it made him even better. “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown”, unless they’re Kumar Sangakkara.
5) JACQUES KALLIS (South Africa): Batting, fielding, bowling; this man had it all in spades. Perhaps the greatest cricket player of the modern era, and an all-rounder beyond compare, apart from the great Sir Garfield Sobers. He won many games for South Africa, it wasn’t always pretty, but he did it consistently. With a better batting average than Tendulkar and Ponting, and a better bowling average than Vettori and Zaheer Khan, how could I not include this colossus of South African cricket?
6) SHAKIB AL-HASAN (Bangladesh): At the time of writing, Shakib has the 3rd-most test runs for Bangladesh, and 3rd-most test wickets, although he has been higher for both. That isn’t really that important; the simple fact of the matter is that, for me, he IS Bangladeshi Cricket. Even though it wasn’t test cricket, the world cup served to cement that fact that he is undoubtedly a superstar of world cricket, and a player of the highest calibre. Well played Shakib.
7) ANDY FLOWER, wicket-keeper (Zimbabwe): The only world-class player to ever come from Zimbabwe, and with The Don removing Gilchrist from the equation, this decision was only made simpler. When people talk about great wicket-keepers, I don’t think this man gets enough of a mention. He was also a pretty good coach for England, so there’s that too.
8) Sir RICHARD HADLEE (New Zealand): Until Kane Williamson came along, there was not doubt that this man was the greatest cricketer New Zealand has ever produced, and he belongs on this list ahead of everyone’s favourite Kiwi on the basis that his incredible bowling ability carried New Zealand through more than an entire decade of test matches. He was also pretty handy with the bat. The first player to reach 400 test wickets, I think he certainly belongs here.
9) WASIM AKRAM (Pakistan): He was once described to me as the best left-arm fast bowler of all-time, and I would’ve been hard-pressed to disagree. He had every trick in the book; he could swing it both ways, he could bowl a vicious bouncer, send down an excellent deceptive slower delivery, and utilise reverse swing to its fullest. He was also capable of holding a bat. There are plenty of good players who could have represented Pakistan, but I don’t think any quite have what Wasim Akram has. He was a player who just had that special something that you only see in players that will go down in history as the best at what they do. Make no mistake, he has.
10) RASHID KHAN (Afghanistan): I had to choose between benching my Irish representative and my representative from Afghanistan. It was difficult, but Rashid’s star power is unquestionable; an all-format player whose spinning can make the best batsmen look average; and I wouldn’t have had a spin bowler after choosing Sangakkara over Muralitharan. So, in the end I went for Rashid Khan. He can bowl, he can bat, he can captain. The only thing I’m not sure of is his age.
11) MALCOLM MARSHALL (West Indies): He could well be the greatest pace bowler that the world has ever seen, and definitely one of the scariest. If I’m being fair, it was very hard to pick my West Indian player; even the fast bowlers (Marshall, Ambrose, Walsh, Holder, Garner, Bishop) could all make a solid claim for being one of the greatest of all time. That’s discounting players of other disciplines, such as Lara, Richards, Sobers, Greenidge, Walcott, and Chanderpaul. In truth, I could have gone with any of them, and it’s for such a reason that I controversially believe that a West-Indian all-time XI would beat any other all-time XI from any other team, never mind being the scariest. In the end, I went with Marshall, who probably was the best of the Caribbean quicks, but it’s a difficult one either way.
12) KEVIN O’BRIEN (Ireland): Dear Ireland, I am very sorry. One team had to be on the bench, and it ended up being you. Hopefully in a few decades time we will be speaking about an Irish player in the same manner as we speak about Tendulkar or Kallis; until then you’ll have to bring out the drinks. It’s also not the worst thing we English have done to you. It could only be one man, to tell the truth. Not only is he Ireland’s only test centurion, but his exploits in limited overs cricket, especially against us (What a great innings that was), suggest that, had Ireland become a test team sooner, he may have been Ireland’s Andy Flower, and that’s no mean feat.",Cricket,1568833899,XpOz222,0,1,True,2019-09-18
413,I created an All-time XII with one player from each test team. Try it yourself in the comments.,"[I don’t know if this has been done before on here; I’ve been around a while and I can’t remember, so I did a search, but nothing came up; sorry in advance if this is well-trodden ground.]
Despite seeming like a simple task, this was actually harder than it looks; I realised right-off-the-bat that I couldn’t simply pick whomever I think were the best players from each test-playing board, because I would probably end up with a team which didn’t have players filling all the appropriate positions (e.g. too many number 3s/4s, not enough openers, no wicket-keeper, not a very good bowling composition). After taking this into consideration, I had to ensure that I balanced filling rolls with picking players that represented their nation as genuine world-class players. I ended up with something that I am pretty happy with (although I am still unsure of some of it), and I wanted to share this with you guys, as I know you all have very strong opinions, and I really want to read your views; and it would be interesting to see if people from other countries (I’m English), think about players very differently. Anyway, I’ve given my reasoning for selecting the players, just in case you’re interested.

1) SUNIL GAVASKAR (India): One of the greatest openers the world has ever seen, and in my opinion the best batsman that India has ever produced. I don’t know how he is viewed in India, but from an English perspective, this guy is criminally underrated. Personally, I would say that he is a tiny bit better than Tendulkar, given how much harder it is opening the batting, the fact that Sunny G played against some of the best bowling attacks of all-time (Looking at you, West Indies), and had fewer minnows to beat-up. I know Tendulkar is beloved in India, and this is not disrespect to a great player, so please don’t hurt me.

2) HERBERT SUTCLIFFE (England): As an Englishman, I must admit that it would be tricky to pick any player that I have ever watched as all-time great. Certainly, Pietersen and Cook were great batsmen, but they don’t belong here; Anderson as a bowler, maybe, but I still think he pales in comparison to the West-Indian pacers of the 70s and 80s. However, when talking with older members of my family, it becomes clear that players like Sutcliffe, Hobbs, and Hammond were phenomenal cricket players. I can only look at statistics, but they certainly back them up. From doing research it seems clear to me that Sutcliffe may have been the best opener in history, so as an Englishman, I’ll take that.

3) DON BRADMAN (Australia): Who else? Probably the easiest pick of the lot. The only issue is that Hayden, Smith, Warne, Gilchrist, McGrath, and many others that have tormented my country for so long must be omitted. Aussies, you don’t know how lucky you are.

4) KUMAR SANGAKKARA, Captain (Sri Lanka): It was a toss-up between choosing Murali and Williamson, or Hadlee and Sanga. I went with the latter because I find it hard to choose a current player from a team with so much history, and because I think Sangakkara was the best batsman of his era, pure and simple. It was a pleasure to watch him bat, every shot effortless and elegant, and the runs just kept coming. A magnificent player and a fine captain, during what was a golden era of cricket in Sri Lanka. Even now, in his early-forties, I reckon he could still put on his cricket whites and destroy the worlds best bowling attacks. I’ve chosen him as captain, because unlike many players, the captaincy did not burden him, if anything it made him even better. “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown”, unless they’re Kumar Sangakkara.

5) JACQUES KALLIS (South Africa): Batting, fielding, bowling; this man had it all in spades.

454,Fab Four,"Of the current Fab Four who would you rate as best overall?

For me I rank them personally on when I've watched them and stats for the three formats and my rankings are:

Tests: 1-Smith, 2-Williamson (firm believer if he played for a country that got regular 3-5 test series his stats would be much better), 3-Kohli, 4- Root.

Reasoning: Smith is far and away the best in this format, just look at his stats. Williamson and Kohli for me are close and I think Kane pips Kohli for the fact there's so much pressure on him and that the Indian side plays more often and generally has a more solid batting line up (theory being easier to score coming in at 2/150 than it is at 1/7). Root has the ability but can't seem to convert starts like the other 3. 

ODI: Kohli, Williamson, Root and Smith.

Reasoning: Kohli is far and away the most damaging ODI player. He can change a game dramatically whilst also build and innings. The other three are innings builders and Smith in particular has struggled in short form as he can't manipulate the bowlers into bowling where he wants as he does in tests because he has time pressures to score quickly.

T20: Kohli, Root, Williamson and Smith.

Reasoning: Kohli again can score big at a fast strikerate. Root can score quicker than Kane whilst tying up and an end and Smith again due to pressure gets out a lot as his technique is made for tests where he can wait for the bowler to put it in his scoring areas and hit through the parts of the field that are unprotected. T20 field is spread out so less unprotected areas and time pressure means Smith often plays a shot and gets caught without having a major impact.

Technique: Williamson, Kohli, Root, Smith. Williamson batting is just a beautiful thing to watch.

TLDR: I'd say Kohli is the best short form, Smith the best test and Williamson is the most consistent without being the best in any format. Whilst Root is the weakest of the 4.

We have seen many unconventional players from these countries excel at the highest level. Not sure how conventional/unconventional Bradman's technique is (I read somewhere in this sub that he too had an unconventional technique)

Even though cricket is hugely popular in sub-continent, many players are not exposed to proper facilities and coaching staff during their initial days. So they sometimes develop unique technique that works for them (eg: Bumrah). Of course, it all comes down to how much a coach allows this and not tend to correct too much.

41,Best test innings you've seen against the team you support?,"After the Ben Stokes classic that kept the ashes classic, I was wondering what was the best test innings I've seen live on tv against my team.

Stokes might come in the top 5, but for me, number one would be VVS Laxman 281, Kolkata, 2001. And that'll be extremely tough to displace.

- We were 16 test wins on the trot.
- Prolly in one of our best bowling phases of our history. McGranth, Warne.
- The position of the game. 1-0 up in the series. India following on.
- Dusty pitch, not ideal batting conditions.

Laxman and Dravid I think batted out entire day 4. It was just unbelievably. I still reckon we might have drawn that test and not lost it if not for some extremely shitty umpiring day 5, but yeah best test innings I've seen live on the telly vs us and prolly of all time 

Would be interesting to see what other fans pick? If we think back to SA last year, ABD at Port Elizabeth was another level, Kohli in Adelaide, Gilly at Hobart or Steve Smith in Pune? Though I'll put Lara at no 2 after Laxman.",Cricket,1567298276,AussieCricFan,68,65,True,2019-08-31

91,High Time for India to go on a test win streak. Road to top the World Test Championship Table.,"Love it or hate it, World Test Championship has made every test friggin important for next two years. Ironically, a test between India and West Indies or NewZealand and SriLanka has more weightage than an Ashes test where the competition is relatively balanced and high profile than the other two.

And I feel BCCI has planned their tours and home series very smartly. A whitewash of Windies is pretty imminent and the next 3 Indian test series for India goes like:

vs South Africa at home 3 tests.

vs Bangladesh at home 2 tests.

vs Newzealand, away 2 tests.

After that India will speculatively play 9 tests against Australia and England.

But heres the fun part the first 7 tests wager 360 WTC points. And the next 9, against tougher teams will carry only 240.

A whitewash win against Saffas is more likely than ever for Indians who are not only formidable at home but have the most balanced teams ever as well.

After that Bangladesh should be a cakewalk and India definitely has the strength to dominate Kiwis if our batsman found the determination to counter swing.

7 straight wins after Antigua will get India at 480 points in WTC with no team any closer in sight.

A 5 test at home against England should at least assure a series win, even if by 2-1 or 3-2 and although I don't see it happening, India can beat Aussies again down under to finish a spectacular campaign.

151,Kemar Roach overtakes Wes Hall to become the 9th highest wicket-taker for West Indies in test cricket with 193 and counting. Might not sound that big a deal but..,"that's a big name he's just overtaken, and have a look at [the names that lie ahead of him](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/westindies/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?class=1;id=4;type=team):

1) The great WI quartet - Holding, Marshall, Roberts, Garner.

2) One of 2 best all-rounders imo to ever grace test cricket, other one being Kapil Dev - Sir Garfield Sobers.

3) The duo that wreaked havoc in the 90s even as the WI test team's performance inevitably declined - Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose.

4) The original West Indies great - Lance Gibbs.

Roach's figures are similar to Hall's too, better SR, almost the same ave and economy rate. He has taken 7 more tests though, which seems to indicate that Hall burdened a larger load.

Talking of loads though, the great pace quarter was so great that they actually leached on each others' stats. Garner and Holding only played about 60 matches. Perhaps a better phrase is very good load management.

Roach's average currently stands at 26.83, SR at 51.3 and least importantly econ at 3.13. His SR is actually better than everyone listed here apart from Garner and Holding.

What's exciting though is that Roach has found his prime at 31, a later than usual age for fast bowlers. A fit 2 more years could mean that he drives his SR below everyone elses and his ave closer to Andy Robert's 25.61, though the ridiculous averages of ~20 by Ambrose, Marshall and Garner are beyond reach.

152,An analysis of KL Rahul's technique: Then vs Now,"So over time KL's technique has become weird and awkward and it has only gotten him out most of the time. I just want to compare the change between KL's old technique vs his current one, I'll also use Steve Smith and Virat Kohli as examples to assist in understanding of what has happened to KL's technique and why it has happened.

I know these three can't be compared but just for analysis sake:  


So remember when Steve Smith didn't have his movement across the stumps and he knicked off quite a lot outside off stump?

[In this video he explains what he did to counter that](https://youtu.be/8YgNi4hfkNY?t=92) 

So to some up the video he says that he created the movement in the WACA test to eliminate that ball outside off stump to help his decision making so he knows which ones to play and which ones to leave. His bat also moved a bit further to almost 4th/5th slip. That's a huge change but it worked for him and it was comfortable and natural for him so he stuck with it.

Here's a pic of his change: 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ec0a5vmyr0k31 ""Sorry if the quality is bad."")

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly in 2014 in England, Kohli was drawn to outside the off stump and he edged off quite a lot too. 

Here's a pic of Kohli opening his hips up, hanging back and just pushing at the ball and nicking it off to the slips:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](sqayv8nyx0k31)

With Kohli him and his batting coaches figured out it was a minor technical adjustment he needed to make his was having his backfoot toe directed towards point as opposed to cover-point because having his toe at cover-point opened his hips up too much and his bottom and really took over and he had to reach for the ball. He also started batting outside the crease to counter some of the swing so that he can get to the ball before it swings too much. He also focused on really getting forward to the ball instead of hanging back and waiting for it to come to him to eliminate a lot of the movement of the ball. By making sure he didn't open up his hip too much and getting right to the ball Kohli countered the swing and edged off quite a lot less. Along with that he practiced very hard in the nets to the point he had cramps in his hand. On top of the technical element, Kohli mentioned that it was the fact that he felt he had so much pressure to perform against England in England so he really wanted to get runs which is why he would fish outside the off stump. TLDR: Kohli made a minor adjustment to his backfoot, got further forward to the ball and worked incredibly hard to counter the swing.

After his adjustments here's Kohli getting right to the ball and staying more side on with his hips and creaming a cover drive:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](ltxl9363y0k31)

  


[If you want to watch and listen to Kohli about his adjustments here's the video.](http://www.bcci.tv/videos/id/3765/masterclass-with-india-captain-virat-kohli)

Now Rahul has developed this problem since late 2017/early 2018. I looked at highlights of his highest score (which is the 199 he got in the same match Karun Nair got the 300) and in that Rahul's bat used to be on 3rd/4th slip and at times he'd completely cover his stumps like so: 

&amp;#x200B;

![img](cyr8h4uqs0k31)

Generally when a player has his bat in a position like that they're comfortable with their technique and are confident in their strokeplay. Rahul used to be clear in his decision making, he was very top hand dominant and his footwork was great where he got right to the pitch of the ball most of the time and swept quite well too. He was following an exact textbook technique which was easy on the eye. Then after playing in conditions where it swings a little more and getting out by fishing outside the off stump one too many times he became very cautious and he showed signs of this when he straightened his bat almost completely to the point it's just a little wider of the keeper and he's moving to middle stump/off stump which still leaves the corridor of uncertainty outside the off stump, here's a picture from literally the current test going on against West Indies:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](byphu2w6u0k31)

By doing so KL has tried to reduce any extra movements in his bat downswing so that all his bat has to do is come down straight. He's a bottom hand dominant player and this has really exposed his bottom hand dominance negatively, almost all of his shots have the bottom hand take over his shot such as the defences he had in the 2nd Indian innings that is currently going on where his bottom hand has always taken control (also as I'm typing this he has just edged off outside the off stump). With KL the problem seems to be that he's become too cautious and this has resulted in his mind not being sure of which ones to play and which ones to let go and due to this his footwork is sometimes stuck in between as well and this results him being edged off. This seems to be a mental thing from KL as he has really become indecisive against a moving ball. To assist with this the team moved him to 3 in the first England test last year where the ball would be slightly older so that when he came in he could settle down much more easily.

Looking at his reaction when he got out on the 199 he looked quite depressed, I think maybe since then he has really focused on not edging off outside the off stump that he's forgotten the footwork element and the top hand dominance element of a batting technique.

However, a few days after England's World Cup victory, was going out when his son and his friend headed out to the field with their ball, a cricket bat and some stumps. He came back in the afternoon, and to his astonishment, he saw that almost all of the younger boys and girls from the neighborhood were engaged in what looked like a proper field cricket match, along with a lot of the parents. And it continued like that for the rest of the summer, with the kids almost always going out to play cricket. In fact, when one of the kids got a football out to play, another one started complaining because they'd enjoyed a summer of playing cricket so much that they didn't want to stop.

I saw India grow from a mid-low tier team to a super power under the great leadership of Ganguly, Kumble and Dhoni. But now we are just a bully of the weak!

We send our A+ team to West Indies/ Sri Lanka who not seen good test players in a long time, and bully them into a victory, just to pad the stats of some of our players or the team as a whole.

Virat Kohli is the most successful test captain now according to they stats. But most of his victories are against piss-ant teams like the ones mentioned above. Before somebody even mentions our victory over Australia in 2018, may I remind you, it was a D-Grade Australia test team!!

 The quality of our cricket was seen in England in 2018. But immediately after that, we get some home turf matches to cover that up and make ourselves feel good about our awesome team! What is happening! The Border-Gavaskar series draw in 2003, to this day feels like a more satisfying end that the sham we got in 2018!

What business do our A-tier players like Kohli, Bumrah, Rohit, Dhawan, Pujara, Bhuvaneshwar etc have to play in West Indies. Im sorry, but that team is super weak! Give the younger guys a chance. Test their potential there, so that when an other WC comes by, we are not left wondering who do we replace our opener or no 4 batsman with!

I urge the BCCI to stop this madness. Kohli is a great player and a captain, but he ain't the best captain! He has a long way to go before he is even thought of as one. Stop hiding his weaknesses with these meaningless test series. And stop sucking the fun out of game! Give the new guys a chance. Give us a chance to be pleasantly surprised by their potential. We need more examples like Navdeep Saini or Hanuma Vihari. I could care less if Bumrah gets a hat-trick against the West Indies. I already know Bumrah is awesome.

280,How could they retool the county championship to better prepare players for test match cricket?,"More games? Less games? Just the obvious better scheduling so it’s not shoehorned into April and September? More teams? Less teams? More divisions?

The way I would do it is 3 divisions, 6 teams in each, 12 games a season. It would make for a more manageable season, you can still start in April with a couple of rounds, a window for the t20 Blast in late May/early June then throughout July and August play championship games Tuesday-Friday with a return to the old Sunday league system for the 50 over cup on...well Sundays. Then the last couple of rounds can still be in September.

On top of that, there has to be more reward for division one teams...I don’t want it too become like football where the premiership has all the money and the football league clubs struggle to stay afloat but there should be an incentive to play in division one so that becomes the place for the elite and the standard is high enough that making the leap to test level is an easier transition. 

I’d also allow more overseas players. 2 or 3 per playing XI, I don’t want to take spots away from Young English talent however, young English talent need to face world class opposition so they can develop their game and be ready for international cricket.

Im probably asking too much with this, we all know the simplest plan is just to move the schedule around so the championship gets better conditions rather than the bowling paradises of April and Late September.

From what I can tell the 3-day series appears to be more of a “youth” set up where younger players are more involved, and please correct me if I’m wrong, so this leads to my main question that f why do both of these competitions achieve First Class designation where that is not the case in other countries?",Cricket,1567491543,kvltc0re,9,28,True,2019-09-03

We'll start the day with some basic lessons, but I'm wondering the best way to structure the game, so it's both easy and fun? 

So far my plan is to have pairs of players who will bat together, I guess for a set number of overs, and then everyone fields together.

I’ve never seen greats like Sachin and Lara, as closely as all of you did. Even though I was born in the 90’s I never understood the genius of these player and then I didn’t watched cricket for years. 

Suddenly idk what happened but I started watching Kohli, and cricket attracted itself to me. I’ve watched every single ball that Indian team played in the past 2 years. I’ve woken up at 5 am to watch the Australia series. I’ve seen every over bowled in this years ashes. I’ve seen Bumrah bowling everyone out. I’ve seen smith hitting back to back centuries. 

And I am absolutely disgusted how everyone here argues who is the best. 
As a person who didn’t even bothered for cricket. 
And now absolutely admires it, I think cricket is the absolute best. 

I can’t argue with anyone as to who is the great. Because maybe pointing, kallis, Sachin, Lara, Brett Lee, were from my generation but I never bothered to watch them as closely as you all did. 

But we should be happy and thankful; we have someone like a smith, Kane, Kohli, Bumrah, archer, broad, Ben stokes.

Who cares who is the best? They all are. Because of them I learned what a cover drive is, at this age they taught me where mid on is. In the end we all are lucky to witness so many beautiful players not once but twice in our age. And I bet many more will come till we all get old. 

I believe cricket and us audience is the real winner.

I'd say this because Tests have always been heralded as the most important form of the game and there are special occasions marked by Test cricket e.g. the Boxing day Test.

T20 is popular with the success of the big bash, and has piqued the interest in casual fans with overseas players and the fast-paced nature of the game.

I suppose our ODI form before the World Cup helped contribute to it's slight decline, but I'm backing it to improve during our summer season. Doesn't help that our domestic List A season has been recently put as a lesser priority.",Cricket,1567519675,TatendaTaibuPornHub,48,46,True,2019-09-03

Here is our data that my colleagues put together for cricket clubs. We were originally only going to look at Twenty20 competitions since those are by far the most numerous in competitions played but we then found that a large number of these leagues were founded only in the past few years, did not have a lot of teams in them and had a history of going out of business quickly. Thus, we broadened our approach and looked at all first-class, limited-overs and Twenty20 club competitions in existence! 

We actually have more info than this and I could have extended the list beyond the number of teams provided here but for the sake of time and keeping people's interest I wanted to limit it to a top 45. Enjoy!

&gt;His inability to convert starts in test cricket are what made me frustrated with him in test cricket. Something like 30 times he got past 50, and only 4 times got to 100. That's an appalling conversion rate. 

I think conversion rates definitely say something about a batsman's temperament. Graham Gooch used to talk about ""daddy hundreds"" - scores of 150 or more. So many batsmen seem to get out just after they've reached 100, it's as if they feel they've achieved their goal and can relax. Gooch considered that scoring a daddy hundred was the real feat.

So anyway I thought it would be fun to dig out some stats.  I restricted myself to Test matches and I looked at all batsmen who have scored at least 10 Test centuries. There are 129 of them, from Tendulkar with 51 down to the likes of Gatting, Latham and Mushtaq with 10 each.

Those 129 batsmen scored 2363 centuries and 3872 50s, but the usual convention is that 50s exclude centuries. So we actually have 6235 scores of 50+, and an average 50-to-100 conversion rate of 38%.

Highest 50-to-100 conversion rates:

https://i.redd.it/ej059h0sujk31.png

No great surprises there, I guess.  Pretty much whatever list you compile, Bradman comes out on top. It's interesting to note that only 13 out of these 129 batsmen had conversion rates of 1-in-2 or better.

There were 747 scores of 150+ in this dataset, so the average conversion rate for 'daddy hundreds' (i.e. converting 100 into 150)  is 32%.

Highest daddy hundred rates:

https://i.redd.it/2s0eskacvjk31.png

Oooh, a list that doesn't have Bradman at the top!  Also interesting that not many batsmen manage a 100-to-150 conversion rate of 1-in-2 or better.

Having done this though, I'm not sure what it really tells us.  For example Graham Gooch, Mr Daddy Hundred himself, is =29th on this particular list, at 40% (8 out of 20). I guess that's not bad, =29th out of 129 on a pretty illustrious list.  But interestingly he is below other English batsmen such as David Gower (20th, 44%, 8 out of 18) and Kevin Pietersen (=22nd, 43%, 10 out of 23) who don't immediately spring to mind when one thinks of hard grafters.  And he's above the likes of Alastair Cook (=53rd, 33%, 11 out of 33) and Geoffrey Boycott (113th, 14%, 3 out of 22) who you do tend to think of as having a high degree of 'stickability'.

And finally let's look at double centuries. There are 262 in this dataset, so the average conversion rate from 100 to 200 is only 11%, and the average conversion rate from 150 to 200 is 35%.

I thought of looking at 150-to-200 conversion rates, but there aren't enough scores of 150+ for the statistics to be terribly meaningful. There were 5 batsmen in the sample whose only 150+ score was actually 200+, so that gives them a 100% conversion rate, but you wouldn't want to rank them above Bradman's 12 out of 18 for 67%.

So instead here are the highest 100-to-200 conversion rates:

https://i.redd.it/upzl37tcxjk31.png

This is pretty similar to the previous list, with the notable omission of Dennis Amiss (=20th, 2 out of 11, 18%).  Perhaps there really is something here.  Batsmen who have the mentality to get daddy hundreds tend to be good at going on to get double hundreds.  And I think this supports the Gooch theory: if you want to get really really big scores, then you need to focus om the daddy hundred; if you're good at turning 100s into daddy hundreds then you're likely to be good at turning hundreds into double hundreds or even bigger.

That's quite interesting, I think.  Happy to discuss.

477,India's #1 Test ranking,"Firstly, hugely impressive, 3 years in a row at the top. 

Secondly, how long more do you reckon it will last? 

They've got 3-match series with SA at Home (in October), 2 match series vs Bangladesh at Home (in November) and then 2 match series away vs NZ (in February)

Here's the rankings and predictors - https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/rankings-predictor/test

I don't see SA getting a win in India, probably a 2 or 3-0 victory to India thus propelling their ratings to 117-118. 

Bangladesh should be a 1 or 2-0 victory to India again, about 119 ratings. 

Then it comes down to the NZ series in February. And even then, NZ have to face Australia Away and England at Home where they could lose points. 

So what do you think, how long will India at #1 last?

490,An Evening At The Jamaica Pegasus - A Meme Comes True,"I recently attended two days of the Jamaica Test between India and West Indies. 

I met Pujara because a friend of mine knows his family. 

I told him I was a big fan and eternal champion of his, and then started with the numbers. He was quite happy listening to my stats about him. I told him he crosses 50 balls 60% of the time, and plays 160 balls on average if he does. He said ""Yeh to bada sahi stat hai!"" (""This is a great stat!""). I told him the context for this: that a wicket falls every 51 balls in Test cricket today, the lowest since 1911. 

I told him about having analysed all his dismissals from the previous overseas cycle, and having found no consistent technical issues. He agreed, and said that it was the experience of having played in these countries before, and the mental prep that made him do better this time, much more than technical adjustments. 

He asked me how I do all these stats, and I told him how I have Cricinfo's database with me and I play around with it to do these. 

He also said that the 'analysis' that happens inside the dressing rooms is mostly video analysis. Players don't want all kinds of stats, as they might mess up their thinking. ""It's good to not see some stats"". 

He was kind enough to get a [picture](https://imgur.com/UnfOF8C) clicked and then also [signed a Che Pujara photo](https://imgur.com/6BTTA3x).

I also told him to let M Vijay know that I love him and cry for him when I'm drunk. 

***

Speaking of being drunk, this Pujara meeting was not the highlight of the evening. 

I headed to the Blend Bar with my friend. We'd seen some great food on the menu, so why not?

We first notice Graeme Swann having a burger at the bar (my friend got a picture with him as he was leaving). 

Next to him was...Shastri. 

God knows how long he'd been there. This was barely two hours after the end of play. We'd heard from some other Indian spectators that he goes straight to the bar without talking to anyone. Seemed true. 

[Here he is, working his nose](https://imgur.com/lDOTCLQ)

As Swann left, Bharat Arun joined Shastri in having Merlot. Shastri was watching highlights on TV, and was least interested in talking, or even looking at us. Bharat Arun was polite enough to acknowledge when we congratulated him on account of the hat-trick Bumrah had taken. Shastri ignored that completely. He had a serious expression on his face (like he always does). 

He was watching highlights of the Florida T20Is, and asking Arun about the Windies bowlers (""Yeh kaun hai? Keemo Paul?"" / ""Who's this? Keemo Paul?""). He seemed very surprised and wowed at Washington Sundar hitting the winning six, almost as if he hadn't seen it himself a few weeks ago. 

He kept gesturing to the bartender to refill his wine glass, with a wagging finger and ""Bro?"". After some time, he says ""Bro? Don't be shy man!"". He had 12 glasses in front of us. God knows how much he'd had before. 

He was asking someone on the phone ""How many can we send in tomorrow? Two? Send in Umesh and Kuldeep."" (*And sure enough, early next morning, those two were bowling on the practice pitches*). 

He was least interested in talking to us, but growled suddenly as I took out the Che Pujara pic to send a snap to my dad. ""You've got him huh? He's a legend! Bob Marley!"" In his typical thunderous voice. 

I said, ""No that's not him, that's the Cuban guy Che Guevara with Pujara's face"". 

He's like ""Pfft, I was joking"" waving us off dismissively. 

Then to defuse this situation, he calls the bar staff. ""You know where I come from, bro? Half a million hits on Twitter!"" He starts showing them some video on his phone, and the poor fuckers have to watch the whole thing out of politeness. He keeps repeating ""half a million hits!"" loudly. 

Then he goes, ""You know, first time I stayed at this hotel? 1984. You weren't even in your mother's womb.""

""First Jamaican boy I faced? Maii-kal Holding."" (in a mock accent). 

He only looked at me fleetingly as I said ""His bat turned again"" as Rohit played a shit shot on TV. 

He was constantly on the phone / messaging, and telling Arun that he's cleaned up his WhatsApp. Arun had to remind him it was already Sunday in India. 

Then the manager joined them and he started making some phone calls. 

I am guessing this is about the squad for the tour games against SA. 

From what I could gather, he's pushing for Rahul Chahar to be included in a red ball team which is going to captained by Rohit, who will also be the opener. If I heard correctly, he wants to fashion ""another Sehwag"" out of Rohit, because he ""is good on our surfaces"". 

He was advocating very strongly for Chahar, saying that he's fitter and stronger, and he wants to see him early. Make him bowl long spells and see what he does. He also wants Rohit to lead this side because Rohit understands Chahar. He was hell bent on getting him in and Rohit opening. He said ""Markande baad mein dekhte rehna"" (""Have a look at Markande later"")

He also said ""When was this Duleep Trophy?"" (LOL it's on right now. I can imagine someone on the other end was telling him about someone doing well in the Duleep Trophy). 

**Completely clueless about domestic cricket, making selection calls that are peak RTG (making Rohit open) based on whims and fancies, while at the bar, giving asshole vibes, and acting borderline boisterous after downing many a drink. The meme was well and truly alive. I can't believe it even now.** 

He was quite drunk through all this. And after the 12th glass, he left for a table. ""I'm going to order some food bro!"". 

Next day, as we sat in the stand right next to the Indian dressing room, I led the chant: ""Rohit For, Opener!"".",Cricket,1567602842,SepulchreOfAzrael,65,154,True,2019-09-04

55,"All filler, no killer. The beauty of cricket radio commentary on a rainy day.","
In north London, near Lord’s cricket ground, the weather forecast is grim. When these dog days of summer get wet it means that the cricket’s off and the resting teams play cards, do press-ups, maybe even chat – for there is a smartphone amnesty in the dressing room to avoid distraction. But for the commentators on radio (and less so TV), there are no such diversions from the job at hand: there might be no play on the pitch but the show must go on.

From 10.30 until 19.00 the commentators, summarisers, experts and guests on BBC Radio’s Test Match Special will look out at a wet field of grass and fill. Fill, fill, fill all day long. They’ll talk about the rain, perhaps the quality, wetness and depth of it, the likelihood of play that hour, then the hour afterwards. They’ll chat about the attire of some of the pluckier spectators who’ve yet to vacate their soggy seats and how they are avoiding… pleurisy, perhaps. Then they’ll play some old interviews with great players. Then, if they’re lucky, it’ll be lunch. Afterwards the cabin fever and chablis might mean they’ll talk about dogs, papercuts, scaffolding, pasta. Then they’ll start on statistics. How many matches or series have actually been improved by rain? What sort of captains came into their own, tactically, in straitened circumstances? Then the famous subject of baking posted to the commentary box: the cakes in funny shapes, the sponges sprung from suggestive moulds. Fill, fill, fill all day long – “Oooh, Matron!”

Radio commentary is a great skill: to say what you see so that those that can’t almost can. But it’s some sort of genius to be able to spend an afternoon enlightening patient millions with wanderings on tree surgery, pigs, lucky socks and bunkers.

124,Improving the Test League,"The major problem with the current test league is that not everyone plays the same amount of games, or plays a similar level of opposition. It hurts the competitive nature of the competition by making the playing field uneven, and also doesn’t really fix the problem of the big teams not playing the small ones, as all these series were agreed on by the boards rather than by some sort of balancing mechanism. 

So how can we fix these in a league while keeping it to 2 years? Well, it’s easier to fix the amount of matches. Make every series a minimum of 3 games (because 2 test series are pretty pointless), and if a series is scheduled to be 3 or more tests, have only the first 3 or last 3 tests count towards the league. 

As for making a more level playing field, I think the best solution is to have 2 groups. So we’d have 2 groups of 5, everyone playing the teams in their group home and away. That gives us 8 series per team, and 24 games. That’s feasible to do in a 2 year time frame. Top team in each group goes to the final, bottom team in each group gets relegated to the Intercontinental Cup (I know that got canned but it would be helpful if it gets brought back), but keeps their test status, with the top 2 I-Cup teams going to the test league. The groups get readjusted every cycle according to the test rankings (the current rankings create a group with India, South Africa, Australia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, and one with New Zealand, England, Sri Lanka, West Indies, and Bangladesh). 

Of course, the glaring issue is that teams aren’t force to play the teams in the other group, which means that they won’t play the teams in the other group unless England and Australia are separated. I’d like to add inter-group games to this, but that adds 5 more series and 15 more matches, which is far too crowded for a 2 year period.

Anyways, this isn’t perfect, complete, or something I’ve spent that long pondering over. It’s just something that tries to address the issues with the current one. The current structure was better than what came before, but there is still room for improvement. We need to try to see that improvement through.",Cricket,1566052854,Stuff2511,2,1,True,2019-08-17

However, only Jos Buttler (36.86) and Woakes (38.00) in the current England XI average more in that period.

171,England’s Test match issues and whether there’s an easy solution. Part 1: Joe Root,"England’s problems are not new ones, we’ve been collapsing for years, we’ve pretty much mastered the art of it if we’re honest. These days though it’s happening more often than not, so, I thought I’d have a think about a few of our biggest issues...this was just going to be one post then I got a bit rambling about Root so I’ll just focus on that for now.

Obviously Joe has found issues with the bat since taking over the captaincy and he hasn’t exactly thrown himself out there as an incredible captain either but there’s no obvious replacement so how can he be helped?

I think the change in coach after the Ashes may be a start. Trevor Bayliss has said from the off, he wants free flowing, in your face cricket but I just don’t see Joe Root as that type of player. He is at heart a bit of a fidgeter, he’s at his best when nudging gaps and rotating the strike and then cashing in on the bad ball. Since becoming captain and the man to lead this Bayliss brand of cricket we find him more and more losing his wicket trying to hard to force the issue. Contrast this to ODI Root who is much closer to his true self, nudges the gaps, continuously rotates the strike and then cashes in on the bad ball. He plays the anchor role in the one day side brilliantly and yet in a test side severely lacking in a middle order anchor, he’s trying too hard to force things into moving quickly. I think the change in coach, hopefully to someone with a more traditional test match mindset will help Joe, possibly relax more into his natural game with the bat rather than attempting to lead from the front with the attacking nature.

From the perspective of captaincy, I don’t think Root is an inherently bad captain. The problem is, it’s all so regimented. They have their plans, they bowl to their plans and if the wickets don’t come it’s almost like they just stop, put men back covering the boundaries and hope a batsman makes a mistake or a bowler produces some magic.

When he was given the captaincy, a lot of people who know him well praised his cricketing mind but I don’t think we’ve seen much of it, Anderson, Broad and the bowling coach set the bowling plans and Root seems just along for the ride. Is it a case of just accepting their experience and going with it or a lack of courage to step up too 2 blokes who have 1000 test wickets between them and say ‘look lads, you’ve got this wrong, I’m changing it.’ I think he finds himself in a similar position to Cook when he first took over. Cooky didn’t really come into his own as captain until 2014 or 15. Once a lot of the senior guys like Swann, Pietersen and Prior we’re gone Cooks confidence grew and he started to form his own style. It’s all well and good leaning on experience, he should listen to what Anderson and Broad have to say but at some point he also needs to step up and be his own man and until we start to see that, we won’t see the best of Joe Root as a captain.

179,Unpopular Opinion: I think the criticism of Joffra is unfair,"To me it looked like as soon as he hit him he walked away possibly in denial of the seriousness of the injury. 

Then once it all settles in he walks towards smith to check. Probably sees Smith in pain but conscious and talking. He doesn’t go in close probably because he is surrounded by medics. 

For me personally, when I’m winded and in pain from a blow, I hate it when the bowler or anyone comes in to check on me. I can actually sympathise with Ricky saying ‘fuck off’ to Javagal out of pure frustration and anger in the moment of extreme pain. So if I were Smith I would actually appreciate Joffra not coming over.

The laughing with Buttler is no issue because it happened a few minutes after the incident. Smith was being attended to and he was conscious. I would reason he was laughing to keep things light because again just to get himself away from the thoughts of the possible consequences of his delivery.

While the blow is similar to what happened to Hughes. In his case Hughes tried to get up and then collapsed and was unconscious. That is obviously a shocking look. 

While with Smith I don’t think he was ever unconscious so it is not as shocking for Joffra and it is much easier for Joffra to reason for his own peace of mind that Smith is ok.",Cricket,1566085404,Bear_Bison,27,24,True,2019-08-17

184,Australian leadership positions.,"Before I start, let me just put this out there. Tim Paine had the hardest job in world cricket post sandpaper-gate and did a fantastic job of it. Honestly, I’m not sure if anyone else in the Australian set up could have done it. From considering retirement, losing love of the game, to being thrust in to the forefront of the most scandalous moment in Australian cricket history, he did it with a relaxed attitude, focussed on his own team, and handled the media pressure exceptionally well. The results never mattered, it was about rebuilding faith and trust in the Australian setup, and he did an excellent job of that and he should be remembered for his exceptional leadership qualities.

Tactically though, I think it is now time for a rethink. Through bad reviews (or lack there of) and average fielding placements, I honestly believe Paine has cost us a solid chance of winning this match. A little reactionary I know, but at least 3 times yesterday, his decision making cost us a wicket at important times. We could have almost wrapped up this test last night. I know the blame isn’t solely with him, the senior bowlers have a lot to answer for, Lyon in particular. No one has seen more LBWs against left-handers than him and he should have been more on to it. Bringing square leg in too close, not having a gully in place, positioning slips too wide, all decisions that also require input from the bowlers, but ultimately, Paine’s decision.

I am 100% against Smith/Warner holding captaincy roles for some time. While I do believe they have in some way reformed, particularly Smith, I don’t want the temptation and pressure of captaincy to even allow the possibility of a culture regression. That said, I think Smith has a more tactical mind and sets better fields and bowling plans than Paine. Mostly because of experience in the field and the mentorship of Clarke, Haddin etc. in his early career.

My question goes now to, who in this set up can fill the role? Head has captaincy experience, but is young and needs to focus on his evolution as a batsmen. Hazlewood and Lyon have the experience but I’m not sure they have the leadership qualities or tactical cricket brains to captain. Wade, no. Khawaja, no. I really wish they had played Finch as a middle order batsmen and he was able to cement his spot in the test side because he is a fantastic captain.

202,"If Lord's is the ""Home of Cricket"" I think this game deserves a new home.","I am fucking disgusted at how Steven Smith was booed off the ground after being hit directly in the head with a 150km/h delivery and was laid flat on the ground for a good while. He clearly wanted to play on and was shut down by the team doctor - so he left the field involuntarily. He was also booed when he returned to the field. 

While I am sure the majority of the crowd - and absolutely all Australians and actual cricket lovers applauded his courage, there were audible boos as he was leaving the field, and also when he returned. I am not even expecting a positive reaction - if the haters simply shut their mouths for a moment that would be fine. But to actually have the fucking nerve to boo this man who is an all-time great of the game, who has just copped a blow to the arm and a blow to the fucking head, and had 2 visits from the team doctors in about 10 minutes, who was laid flat on the deck for a few minutes - is just fucking appalling.

Also fuck Jofra Archer for having a giggle at the top of his mark. I recall an actual class act like Brett Lee who when he hit Alex Tudor, he, along with the entire team ran over and Lee was kneeling over him in distress.  Oh yea, when Tudor left the field there was only applause from the Australian crowd. Not a single audible boo.

I know a lot of English fans have expressed their dissatisfaction at the crowd's behaviour, so it's unfortunate that the minority have tainted the entire fanbase.

266,What if the Test Championship existed in the last 3 year cycle (2017-2019): Table and fixtures inside,"Before I get to the table, allow me to explain the format briefly, as the tours didn't quite allow for a perfect replication of the current system.

Just like the existing format, each team has three (3) home and three (3) away series included. Each series is worth 120 points, yadda yadda, that's all the same.

The problem arose that NZ had only played one away series during this timeframe, and SAf only two. To accommodate for this, their results were scaled to match three series'. 

For example: NZ played 3 tests away for 1 win and 2 losses, for a series point total of 40. This scaled to 3 wins, 6 losses, and 120 points total.

280,Is there a place for injury substitutes in Test cricket?,"The inclusion of concussion substitutes in the ongoing Ashes Test, which has resulted in the replacement of Steve Smith with Marnus Labuschagne for the fifth day, is definitely a positive move for player welfare. However, I do wonder if it goes quite far enough, and whether it could be rationalised to do away with the arbitrary ""like-for-like player"" requirement.

My proposal would be for both teams to **nominate two injury substitutes** ahead of the match. These players could serve as substitute fielders, and be called upon to **replace any player who is ruled out of the remainder of the Test by a doctor**. So, in the current Test match, these might have been the two teams' match squads:

**England**

1. Rory Burns
2. Jason Roy
3. Joe Root (CAP)
4. Joe Denly
5. Jos Buttler
6. Ben Stokes
7. Jonny Bairstow (WKT)
8. Chris Woakes
9. Jofra Archer
10. Stuart Broad
11. Jack Leach
12. Dom Sibley (SUB)
13. Sam Curran (SUB)

**Australia**

1. David Warner
2. Cameron Bancroft
3. Usman Khawaja
4. Steve Smith
5. Travis Head
6. Matthew Wade
7. Tim Paine (CAP, WKT)
8. Pat Cummins
9. Peter Siddle
10. Nathan Lyon
11. Josh Hazlewood
12. Marnus Labuschagne (SUB)
13. Mitchell Starc (SUB)

Now this proposal probably raises some questions, including:

&amp;#x200B;

* **What would stop a team from using it tactically to replace a bowler with a batsman, or vice versa?**

The match referee would have final approval over which of the two nominated substitutes a team introduces in order to avoid gaining an injury.

&amp;#x200B;

* **How would you guarantee the impartiality of the doctor in question?**

You probably couldn't, but I believe it's worth the risk of a player being subbed out too soon to avoid the risk of them playing through potentially serious injury.

&amp;#x200B;

* **What would it do to 140 years of Test statistics to start playing thirteen-a-side?**

The same as substitutes for international call-ups did to first-class statistics after 300 years of statistics that included overarm and underarm bowling, covered and uncovered pitches, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Would it pave the way for tactical substitutions later on?**

Probably. Although there's an argument that this would raise standards and create a better product for spectators.

329,Should Steve Smith have been allowed to bat again?,"In the light in of the news that he had a delayed concussion, yesterdays events take on a morally problematic tone for everyone involved, including us, the audience.

Cricketers brain injury problems are different from the contact football codes, where there is some indication that years of frequent, but often contextually trivial head knocks have a cumulative effect that can eventually cause CTE.

Cricket has the problem of infrequent, but potentially highly damaging or even lethal head knocks. The worst case scenario being a player who has already sustained a concussion and then gets hit again in the same game. The likelyhood of serious injury or even death in this case is alarmingly high.

So as much as I love test cricket, as much as the battle between Smith and Archer yesterday was one of the most interesting things one could possibly see, you have to wonder how much longer it can go on.

The difference is they won't overturned since they weren't reviewed 

And while Paine and Langer have been grieving over missed reviews, the umpires did get it wrong, didn't they? Again and again.

Out on Back page live, I remember Crash talking about how 9/14 umpires on the elite panel are from either Aus or Eng and aren't neutral - so aren't involved, but what we saw in tests of these magnitude wasn't elite. It was piss poor stuff 

Which brings us to more tech questions. Why can't an umpire consult with the third umpire if he isn't sure of an lbw? Give a soft signal and let them check if it's something blatant that you've missed.

As of this moment, I have not looked at the schedule, but my concern is: One of two things must be true for the participating teams - 

1. Maximum number of points that can be secured (points on winning every match played) is same for all teams. **OR**
2. Number of matches played is same 

Now, option 2 would be clearly unfair due to the varying number of matches in different series, but option 1 does not solve all problems either.

A basic rule change necessary for this competition is that ICC ensures that each and every team plays the same amount of tests overall in a cycle


If you don't have a min amount of tests you need to play,why will the lesser teams even play anything but 2-3 match series'?They know they won't get too many points from a 4-5 match one because of the low points/win distribution in such a scenario, they'll always take this route.

You're probably thinking right now of Jofra Archer's most recent spell, or of Mitch Johnson in the 2013-14 Ashes series. In both instances batsmen were struck on the head, and in Jofra's case, Steve Smith was hit in a similar area of the head/neck as Phil Hughes was. Even if Smith was wearing a neck guard, irreversible brain trauma can occur.

Take for example club cricket, especially junior cricket. I have seen many instances where an especially tall and intimidating bowler was bowling bumpers aimed at kids who were half his size and genuine bunnies. These kids were shitting themselves, and I have seen a few concussed from blows. There is also the increased risk of depression and other mental health disorders, with Will Pucovski being a recent example.

The question is, if there is a rule change, how can we implement these changes so as the batsman is not too well off and express bowlers don't get the short end of the stick?",Cricket,1566205214,TatendaTaibuPornHub,103,7,True,2019-08-19

496,Aussie XI Discussion.,"Australia are a few good tests away from winning an away series in England for the first time I can remember. A fine performance in the first test was followed by a drawn second test where victory was still in reach on the start of Day 5. 

However, these successes have come mostly off the back of our bowlers and Steve Smith.

Here I will discuss the playing XI for the third test, focusing mostly on the batting lineup. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Cameron Bancroft - A very disappointing performance for the batsman. He has not scored above 20 in this series so far, and whilst he has seen many balls faced, and spent quite some time at the crease, has failed to capitalise on these innings. Furthermore, his technique seems to have a number of flaws that suggest he is not long for this team. He should be looking over his shoulder at Harris and Burns, and needs to have an impact in the third test. 
2. David Warner - Coming off a successful world cup campaign with a number of good scores to his name, he has runs in the bank to back up his inclusion. Unfortunately, he has not had any impact on this series so far, having not even scored above 10 runs in either match. Whilst he certainly has some brownie points from his world cup performance, he needs to start making scores, or he too is in danger of being dropped.
3. Usman Khawaja - Some encouraging signs, to be sure, but he has still been very disappointing. As a senior, experienced member of the squad, he has been performing below expectations. Whilst not in any immediate danger of being dropped, needs to lift for the remainder of the series.
4. Smith/Labuschagne - Steve Smith has been the main run-getter for the team so far, and is in no danger whatsoever of being dropped if able to play. However, for the third test there is a question mark over his health. Surprisingly, Labuschagne has risen to the task, scoring in one innings more than Bancroft or Warner. Having performed well in other games, there should be no doubt to his place if Smith is unavailable. 
5. Travis Head - Another bright spot for the batting lineup, Head has scored a total of 135 (I think) runs in the series so far, creating vital partnerships with Smith and Labuschagne. He has also been not out twice in this series. However, his conversion rate is still somewhat worrying, with five 50s but only one century. Still, has certainly proven he has what it takes, and is an exciting prospect for the future.
6. Matt Wade - Has certainly justified his inclusion so far, having scored a century in the second innings of the First Test. However, he has failed to hit double figures on three other occasions. Whilst not in the firing line, Some more consistency and ability to stick it out when the innings have gotten dicey would be on the top of his to-do list. 
7. Tim Paine - Tim Paine holds an interesting place in the team, being not especially successful. However, he has played well enough, making some useful runs and working well in partnerships. His place as captain means he is essentially undroppable for the series, but no matter whether he brings the Ashes home or not, his term as captain, or even member of the playing XI, could conceivably be in doubt (although he is far from the first priority)
8.  Pat Cummins - Along with Lyons, he is probably the bowler least likely to be dropped or substituted. He has been rocketing up the test rankings, and is good with both bat and ball. In no danger whatsoever.
9. Nathan Lyons - Whilst his skills were not suited to the second test, with the pitch having about three days worth of play on its surface, he still bowled well, taking three wickets in the first innings and being unlucky not to have any in the second. 
10. Josh ""Hazlewood"" Hazlewood - Replacing the fatigued Pattinson for the second test, he justified himself with three vital wickets in the first innings. However, he may be dropped to make room for the rested Pattinson, who has incumbency status. 
11. Peter Siddle - Siddle's figures may not make for interesting reading, but he has bowled far better than his figures. Unlucky not to have more wickets than he has done, he has been the main victim of fielding woes. He has bowled very well, but may be dropped to make room for Pattinson if the selectors decide Hazlewood is better for the conditions.

Honourable Mention. Mitchell Starc - Starc is one of the bowlers many would have expected to see play, but it appears the selectors have made the right choice in selecting others. Unless one of the pitches is especially conducive to his style of bowling, it seems unlikely he will play in this series. However, if there is an injury to Cummins, Siddle or Pattinson he is certainly in contention to take the spot at the expense of Hazlewood. 

&amp;#x200B;

2,Being Steve Smith is cheating,"Hello,

I'd like to draw attention to a blight that has recently been ruining my enjoyment of the game - namely, the cheating of a certain Steve Smith by the nefarious method of being Steve Smith. By the dictionary definition, cheating is: ""to violate rules dishonestly"". While I admit that being Steve Smith doesn't exactly violate rules laid out in the cricket rulebook, it does violate the spirit of the game, and does so in a way that harms cricket.


It is clear that being Steve Smith conveys a large advantage on the player who is being Steve Smith. If we compare Steve Smith (who has a long history of being Steve Smith) to another player, say, Joe Denly, we can see this advantage materialised in their various statistics. Steve Smith has a test average of 61.37 from 64 matches and 117 innings, scoring 24 50s and 23 100s with a top score of 239. Joe Denly has a first class average of 36.70 with 56 50s and 29 100s from 198 matches and 342 innings, playing against significantly weaker bowling attacks. It's clear that Steve Smith is acquiring an advantage over Joe Denly by being Steve Smith.


Additionally, it is my contention that this advantage is dishonest. If it were an honest strategy, it is one that could be implemented by any player. But if Joe Denly cannot be Steve Smith because he is not Steve Smith. That is fundamentally unfair - a strategy which is one sided like this (only in favour of Steve Smith and any teams he plays for) unbalances the game in favour of Steve Smith.


One of the most common wishes for a cricket match is a good contest between bat and ball. When Steve Smith is batting, this goes out the window, because the bat is always dominating the ball. I think this is fundamentally bad for cricket as Steve Smith will ultimately make the game boring if it is just Steve Smith chancelessly compiling endless centuries.

Being Steve Smith created a strategy that revolved around defeating your opponent by bowling out every opposition player that is not Steve Smith. Being able to dismiss all the opposition players makes a game of cricket more fun and compelling , but not being able to dismiss one of the batsmen at one of the ends is not particularly fun or interactive.


I understand that there may be some concerns that we are discriminating against Steve Smith, and of course Steve Smith was born being Steve Smith and being Steve Smith is part of his identity. For that reason I think any ban handed down by the ICC should be relatively light - just a warning to Steve Smith to stop being Steve Smith and perhaps to try being someone else (like Joe Denly). I propose therefore that Steve Smith should be banned for the next, say, four full test matches and four days. This highly specific number should encourage Steve Smith to take a long hard look at himself in the mirror and perhaps stop being Steve Smith, and also help to even any contests or test series that he may or may not currently be involved in. If, after this sanction, by August 14 2020, Steve Smith has persisted in being Steve Smith, the ICC should consider banning him for a further 5 test matches so he really gets the point.

Smith and Williamson are two players of the current time whom I really admire for their nature of calmness shown under stress. It was definitely strenuous for Steve to perform with the bat without getting much support from the batsmen, and with all the chants by the English supporters throughout the day.

Watching him get to 30 runs today you could tell he was getting a century, he was so comfortable at the crease. I will remind you that Smith also has the second highest ICC test batting rating ever.

* I wish Kohli was reigned in. I can see that captaincy brings out the best in him, but he would do well as just a batsman too - only if there was a good leader in the Indian team that Kohli could bury his ego for and just bat. 

* Root has a much better attitude in this regard and I can see him taking that route in the future to prolong his batting.

What the actual fuck? How could the umpires be wrong so often?

Okay so lets go over it from the top (might have missed some that weren't in Highlights packages)

&amp;#x200B;

Warner - Given not out for LBW, upheld on review (Correct)

&amp;#x200B;

Warner - Caught out nicking toe of bat - Given not out (**Wrong**)

&amp;#x200B;

Warner - LBW, not reviewed but missing leg stump (**Wrong**)

&amp;#x200B;

Bancroft - Out caught off thick edge (On field umpire can't really be wrong as low catches go to third umpire anyway)

&amp;#x200B;

Khawaja - Given not out for nick, overturned on review (**Wrong**)

&amp;#x200B;

Head -  Given out LBW, confirmed right decision by hawkeye (Actually correct!)

&amp;#x200B;

Smith - Out LBW outside off stump, overturned on DRS, possibly the most blatant wrong one of all? (**Wrong**)

&amp;#x200B;

Wade - Given not out, overturned on DRS (**Wrong**)

&amp;#x200B;

Paine - Caught in the deep, impossible to not give out, umpire not actually needed (We'll call that Correct though for fairness)

&amp;#x200B;

Pattinson - Given out LBW, turned out to be wrong on Hawkeye but not reviewed (**Wrong**)

&amp;#x200B;

Cummins - Given out LBW, confirmed correct by DRS (Correct!)

&amp;#x200B;

Siddle - Given out LBW, overturned on Snicko (**Wrong**)

&amp;#x200B;

Siddle - Given out caught, sometimes those ones are off the pads unlike other catches so umpire needed  (Correct)

&amp;#x200B;

Smith - Clean bowled, umpires need not apply (correct)

&amp;#x200B;

**SEVEN**  wrong calls, two obvious catches that don't really require a field umpire to determine, a clean bowl that also doesn't need an umpire, the siddle catch which arguably does need an umpire as balls from spinners sometimes bounce up like that off the pads but looked pretty hard to get wrong IMO and two actually correct LBW decisions.

""There were times throughout the last 15 months where I didn't know if I was ever going to play cricket again,"" Smith said in Birmingham. ""I lost a bit of love for it at one point, particularly when I had my elbow operation, and it was really bizarre, it was the day when I got my brace off my elbow I found my love for it again. I don't know what it was, it was like a trigger to go again, I want to play, I want to go out and play for Australia and I guess make people proud and just do what I love doing.

""I've never sort of had those feelings ever before where I didn't have a great love for the game and it was there for a little while. Fortunately that love's come back and I'm really grateful to be in this position now, playing for Australia again and doing what I love.""

 I didn't really know what to do to be honest, it's been a long time coming, but I'm just, I don't know, I'm sort of lost for words at the moment,"" Smith said of the moment he reached his century. ""Just really proud that I was able to help pull the team out of a little bit of trouble. Obviously England bowled exceptionally well in the first two sessions and it was hard work out there, I'm just proud that I was able to dig in and fight through the difficult periods and get ourselves to a competitive total.

""I think it has got to be one of my best hundreds, definitely, first Ashes Test match, the ball was doing a fair bit out in the morning so I had to work really hard. I got beaten a few times but I just had to let that go and concentrated on the next ball and kept digging in, I know that the first Test for an Ashes series is always big. I didn't want to give my wicket up easily, I wanted to keep fighting and fortunately I was able to dig in today and get ourselves to a reasonable total I think.

""I thought Peter Siddle did a magnificent job, that partnership we were able to form and Nathan Lyon as well, he was magnificent. He actually said to me that's the most nervous I've ever been out in the middle batting so to be able to get to my hundred and give him a really big hug and let all my emotions out that was really special.

 ""It doesn't bother me to be perfectly honest, I know I've got the support of the guys in the room and for me that's all that really matters,"" he said. ""They went berserk on the balcony when I got to a hundred and just looking up at them really sent shivers down my spine. It's been a long time coming, getting another Test hundred, and it was a huge moment and I'm lost for words, I don't really know what to say at the moment."" 

 ""I obviously don't have the arm band, and that's ok,"" Smith said. ""I think Tim's done a magnificent job the last 18 months or whatever it is, and for me I'm obviously an experienced player now and an experienced person in the dressing room and you want your experienced players to stand up when its difficult and show the way in a way. Fortunately I was able to do that today.

""Sometimes you need your tail to dig in with you. Everyone gets to bat, so you might as well try and improve it, and to their credit the bottom four and the bowlers that are on the bench have worked incredibly hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a game plan that works in England. Try and get their defence in order and playing the ball really late and all those kinds of things.

114,"I've deciphered the architect of England's test batting problems over the last few years, its an inside job after all.","Its that bat, that bloody **New Balance** bat. That bat is everything that has brought destruction upon England and only Ben Stokes and Joe Root to some degree have been able to wield it but at what cost?

  
Joe Root was a truly exceptional player when he was shooting it down with the Gunn and Moore bat and since he's switched to the New Balance bat, his batting form in test cricket has gone down. 

Gary Ballance started off beautifully before he switched to NB, understandably, with them sharing a name, the sponsorship was inevitable but then the synergy happened and he couldn't swat a fly with his bat. 

Remember World Class number 3 Jonathan Trott? He. was the best number 3 in the world with Gunn and Moore and that soon went to shit when he switched to New Balance and couldn't cope with cricket. 

Rory Burns looks like there will be a ball where he won't be able to get his bat down from god knows where he holds it like its the Stormbreaker. And of course he uses NB. 

Jason Roy in test cricket? Let's not talk about it. At least not as an opener. 

Only Ben Stokes has been consistently able to wield the cursed New Balance bat, it takes too much collateral per performance, bring back the days where the bats were evenly split from GM, GN, V and Adidas, that's the problem. The bloody bat is cursed and we need to lodge an investigation into it.

Honestly, there should be a guy on the field, but all he should be doing is conveying the decision obtained through using the DRS tech we have available. Oh, a team appealed for lbw? Well, automatically, the third umpire should have a look and let the on-field umpire know whether it was out or no. Oh, what's that? A nick? Well just wait a moment and the third umpire will let you know. 

Humans simply do not have the ability to get it right every time but computers do. We have them available. Why not use them? Honestly, it's beyond me. Anyone else agree?",Cricket,1564746655,ALYSTEVENSON,8,5,True,2019-08-02

172,Laws that need a review.,"After the dust has settled on the World Cup final the ICC will almost certainly have to review the law about overthrows. 

Which other laws have unnecessary ambiguity in them that could do with being cleared up?

I’ll start by saying that it’s not clear when a stumping becomes a run out. For example, batsman charges a fast bowler and misses, no ball is called, keeper throws down the stumps and the batsman is out of his ground. Can’t be stumped off a no ball, Is this out? What if the keeper fumbles the ball first?",Cricket,1564767326,jugglingeek,12,0,True,2019-08-02

Cleaned up some fields and added the last 2 columns. 

Higher the number of innings, worse it is.  New Zealand openers have been exceptional here, played a lot fewer innings but still on par on 100s with the top teams. If they are not scoring 100s, they are scoring a 50 in every 5th innings. And they are the best in it. Pakistan are right behind them in 50s .  


NZ also used fewer openers - 3. Tom Latham got 5 100s (with a 264\*). Jeet got 1 and Guptill has 0.

* 2. Radio Only. Who needs images, I have my imagination.

* 3. TV on Mute, Radio commentary. Channel Nine sucks without Richie or it was better when I couldn't see Kerry O'Keefe. (insert real reason here like it's just better this way)

* 4. TV commentary. Banter, lads.

*  5. Live at ground only, only need my mates and the cricket club bar to enjoy this. (If you're at a Hurricanes game and constantly start a wave at every break, I hate you.)

For what we’ve got though, it seems rather than it all being on one bloke in Pietersen, the entire team just fell apart and lost it mentally.

I don’t really buy into the bowlers being full blown bully’s, they just seem like grumpy blokes who really aren’t happy if things aren’t going their way. I also don’t entirely buy Swann saying KP sent his media mates after Cook. I just don’t think Piers Morgan needs someone to tell him to be an odious cunt and given Cook said himself in his retirement interview that his view was that Pietersen needed a break rather than being put out all together but it wasn’t in his hands, it just seems a little off.",Cricket,1564819285,NiallH22,8,21,True,2019-08-03

236,The umpiring so far this test match.,"Obviously it’s been appalling. 10 or so wrong decisions I think. 

However I think the backlash against them is unfair - as well as having some tough decisions like when the ball hit roots stumps most decisions they got wrong, the players also got wrong.

Warner and pattinson could have reviewed yesterday, Paine could have reviewed against Burns and there were a few others. 

So yes the umpiring has been pretty disappointing and I think Ponting has raised good points about getting rid of neutral umpires but DRS was introduced for a reason - and that was to correct bad umpiring decisions which obviously are going to happen for time to time. 

Unlike Erasmus giving Taylor out wrongly in the final where Taylor wanted to review and couldn’t - the players could have reviewed and chose not to, in the minds of the players the decision wasn’t an absolute howler that needed reviewing.

So just give the umps a break - it’s bloody hard work and everyone has a bad day at the office.",Cricket,1564824300,banrepcfoo,4,0,True,2019-08-03

Just like the big venues, they had a couple of very  visible strips of grass/dirt which I assume are different wickets they play on. Since they were just a friendly side, they were playing on the one closest to the club house leading to a very short and lumpy boundary near the clubhouse.

I assume local sides rotate which of the several wickets they use (maybe saving the centered ones for club matches) but do the bigger grounds do the same?

'Past Average (PA) - Future Average (FA)'

PA is a bowlers average until some point in their career, FA is their average from that point on. For bowlers we will use split = PA-FA so that positive split values correspond with an improved (lower) average in the future and negative values correspond with a worse (higher) average in the future.

By calculating the split at all points throughout their career we can see which of them has had the largest future overperformance or underperformance based on what their bowling average was at some point in time.


When finding the top 20's, split values during the first or final 45 wickets taken in a career are ignored to avoid a small sample size bringing less significant results to the fore.

The 20 bowlers with the highest maximum split value, at some point in their career their future average was much lower than their past average:

Bowling change ups have been good though, despite only having 4 specialists in the team.
We'll have to see how his captaincy develops as the Ashes progresses. I think it's been a decent start, but he needs to set an example with the bat if he needs to come in at any point. I'm optimistic, how about you, Aussie fans?",Cricket,1564859272,y_v_k,23,19,True,2019-08-03

When I threw the ball to the Keeper, the captain appealed for obstructing the field to the disgust of the slip cordon and bowler, for which I was given out. I was under the impression that the ball was dead once it had been lodged in equipment. The umpire claimed to have not heard me ask the keeper if he would like the ball back.

I started career as Batting all rounder (left arm wrist spin). But I have utterly no knowledge of cricket

I got a little used to batting (playing easy difficulty for batting), all others in medium difficulty

Coming to bowling

I think leg break turns the ball to right and googly turns it to left..

But what is Top Spin? Slider? Flight?

What does pitch type has to do with bowling?
Also what's long/short pitch? 

All I am doing right now is bowling leg break for right hand batsman and googly for left hand batsman varying between the lengths(good, full, yorker), though it is being economical I don't get wickets, was able to get many maiden overs (I think that's because it's spin bowling and not my talent)

376,Why Broad's non-walk is so infamous. (My Hypothesis),"OK cunts, considering that Broad's non-walk has come up a bit on this sub as of late, here's my hypothesis as to why Broad not walking is so infamous, whilst pretty much every other time nobody bats an eye.

Would like to preface this by saying that that the booing of, and general hatred towards Broad by Aussies, particularly during 2013-16, was really stupid, somewhat shameful, and incredibly classless. Although, under the same circumstances almost any country would have a similar reaction.



The circumstances were pretty extreme in the Broad case. The edge was so fucking blatant, and every Aussie fielder knew it was out, however, as the Aussies had no review, it couldn't be overturned. 

When Broad didn't walk, he was 37\*, and batting with an accomplished and set batsman at the crease, Ian Bell on 77\*. Had Broad been given out, the partnership would have been ended. The Two put on a further 59 runs in their Partnership, and England only made a total 11 runs from their last 3 batsman combined. We can assume conservatively that the non-dismissal of Broad cost Australia at a very minimum 40 runs, and theoretically 59.

Australia would lose the Test match by a mere 14 runs. Had Broad walked, It is highly likely that Australia would have won the Test match.

Had Broad walked, There is a decent chance that Australia would have had the ability to turn their results around later in the tour, given that they would not have suffered such a demoralising loss first up. A 3-0 loss would have been at least a 2-1 loss, and possibly even a 2-1 win or 2-2 Draw.

Factor this in with some other contributing factors, such that he didn't walk on a delivery from a 19 year old debutant (Emotional factor that makes us sympathise with 'the underdog'), and that Australia received the worst 3rd umpire decision of all time with Usman Khawaja being given out unfathomably (Makes us sympathise with Australia as they could be seen to have been treated unjustly oncemore), and Australia could present themselves somewhat that they were absolute victims of an unjust scenario.

Essentially, the Broad case embodied the sort of bad luck that  Australians believed they recieved in that Ashes series.

Furthermore, with the next Ashes series directly following this one in Australia, Broad's indiscretion was foremost in  the minds of Aussie cricket fans, who were now seeking revenge and justice for this 'wrong'.

And now, the reason why we remember this so much now has much to do with the fact that the 5-0 whitewash of England showcased a sort of justice in our animal brains, particularly given just how annihilated England was, and particularly how toothless Broad's bowling was, and how scared he was with the bat. 


Essentially, Broad not walking probably caused Australia to lose the Trent Bridge test, possibly but unlikely caused Australia to lose the series, and this caused great resentment within the greater Australian Cricket community. When Broad and England received what could be seen as a form of 'justice' for this indiscretion, the incident was firmly planted in our conscience, and as such we have never forgotten it.

Basically, if I want to get all wanky about it, Broad is the perfect Aristotelian Tragic Hero. His stature was grand, as he caused England to beat Australia, but only via his non-walking, which was his tragic flaw, which lead to his great downfall, which was the 2013-14 Ashes.



Should he have walked? It would have been nice, but it's unfortunately not the done thing by most international batsman.

**TL:DR, It's the culmination of misplaced anger at a Test match loss, which may well have cost Australia the series.  Aussies were angered by the outcome of the event, rather than merely the action, which lead to a boil-over of emotion and therefore Broad became a villain, even if unfairly.**",Cricket,1564908532,legoland6000,9,8,True,2019-08-04

I'm travelling from India to the UK for a vacation in August, and have just managed to snag a ticket from the official website for the Ashes Lord's test (yay! yay!). Given that I won't be in India for the ticket delivery, I've given my Airbnb address for the delivery.

I'm just a bit nervous, so wanted to ask some questions from folks who have purchased these tickets before/for this match:

1. Will I receive any confirmation from the Lord's team on the delivery of the tickets, once it's delivered? So far I've only received a payment confirmation and a V.A.T. Reg No., but no delivery tracking number.
2. Will the purchaser's name be there on the ticket, or can anyone who gets their hands on it use the ticket? My Airbnb host has been very accommodating in allowing me to use his address, but I'm just a bit scared about the ticket getting lost in the mail, and don't want someone else using it in case they get delivery of the tickets.

465,The thing about Steve Smith," Steve Smith is without a doubt the best batsman I have ever witnessed and proberbly one of the best batsmen ever. However what has happened since his return to cricket is not redemption or a fairytale return to the game. He is and will always be a cheat, he was the captain of a national team and lead them out with sandpaper to cheat. It's a discrase the way the media are treating Smith, like he is a God and deserves respect he dosent and is and will always be a cheat. I was at Edgbaston when he scored his century in the first innings and would always clap an opposition player when they reach a milestone (including David Warner and Cameron Barcroft) but I could never clap a captain who knowingly cheated. On a side note we all know that even if Tim Payne is the bee captain Smith is still calling the shots on that team. It's fair enough that people talk about what an amazing batsmen he is because he is amazing but he dosent have redemption because you can never change the character of a man and at the end of the day he is a cheat.",Cricket,1564941388,gwilt123,23,0,True,2019-08-04
466,Steve Smith almost unbeatable Batting Superman,"  

To all that watch this guy play his unbeatable knocks you have to think as a bowler is Steve Smith unbowlable? He seems to have the insight to read virtually every ball bowled at him and he usually answers it with a 4 or even a 6.

The problem I have with Steve Smith is yes he is an exceptional batsman and that makes it all the more shite because even though he is a great player and can read a bowler very well and scores big he is a CHEAT? and always will be a CHEAT? And I suppose if he was a shite player or even mediocre that would be a little easier to bear.

So rather than watch Steve Smith bat I decide to turn off and not watch him as the fundamental rule has always been law and that is no matter how big he scores and no matter how many times people say he is an exceptional batsman he will always be a Cheat, Because he himself felt that as viewed him being a top class batsman in himself that was not enough, Because the need to win and cheat invalidated all the rule’s and fair play he may have once held.

470,Jonny Bairstow: England's Undroppable Man. Part 2,"I have been very [anti-Bairstow recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/chqnfi/jonny_bairstow_englands_undroppable_man/) and I really don't want to attack someone when he's down, but I do think that there are things that need to be addressed.

In my previous post, I said that his wicketkeeping is not as good as definitely Foakes and probably Buttler. Wicketkeeping is very difficult to judge because there are so many nuances to the art that many of us simply do not understand. However, confirming what I suspected, Sangakkara led two 'third man pieces' (analysis pieces) on how Jonny Bairstow's keeping position is simply wrong and leaves him viable to make mistakes especially to under edges standing up to the stumps. The facts are that he missed a stumping that Sanga said he would expect Paine to complete 3/5 times. To highlight his 'undroppable-ness', on both those two occasions, Botham and Nasser (I think) made excuses for Jonny saying that they were difficult chances on a difficult pitch. However with respect to them, their opinion is worthless compared to an actual Wicketkeeper in Sangakkara.

A Wicketkeeper is hard to judge with stats, but lets have a look at them anyway, in comparing runs scored to byes conceded

1st Test v Australia: -3 (8 + -11) \*Liable to change

1st Test v Ireland: -11 (0 + -11)

3rd Test v West Indies: 1 (2 + -1)

Now Foakes;

2nd Test v West Indies: 40 (48 + -8)

1st Test v West Indies:  6 (7 + -1)

The difference is staggering really. The past two tests has seen Bairstow concede 22 byes while contributing 8\* runs. Maybe Foakes isn't the answer but it sure isn't Bairstow. Foakes is a brilliant keeper but he's for some reason nowhere near the squad... maybe Root saw what sort of school Foakes went to.

So why is he undroppable this time? Well the reasons haven't really changed except for the fact that his weakness in wicket keeping has been really highlighted this test especially. Will he be dropped this time? Surely he must be after these dire performances. No. He won't be, I'm almost sure of it. He's Root's mate at the end of the day, and he has the nauseating 'credit in the bank'. So I'd get used to seeing his ginger face reviewing decisions that even Aleem Dar thinks is far fetched.

488,"Smith's chance to ""surpass"" Bradman","Nothing particularly special, but Smith has a chance to ""pass"" Bradman in a sense this series. 

There are two records up for grabs for Smith, but the one regarding Bradman follows due to him only playing 80 innings, but averaging ridiculously more than anyone else. If you ""continued"" Bradman's career with nothing but ducks, you could increase his innings count until he was comparable. 

At this time Smith has played 119 innings, averaging 62.96. Bradman, extended to 119 innings (ie + 39 ducks) would average 64.18. In the next few innings Smith has a chance to catch Bradman here:

Dismissals | Score Required
:-- | :-- | :--
0 | 66
1 | 130
2 | 193

etc

The current record holder for the first to ""surpass Bradman"" is Wally Hammond who did so in 125 innings, with him averaging 60.93, while Bradman ""averaged"" 60.83. 

Another record in his reach is Sobers' peak average after more than 80 innings played, which was 63.75. To surpass this Smith needs 83 runs if he is not out in his next innings or 146 if he is dismissed.

0,"Elder Wand ranking in ODI cricket, and who is No.1?","  

I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/avalxf/elder_wand_ranking_in_test_cricket_and_who_is_no1/) a while back, and now that the World Cup is over with England as Champions, I wondered what the Elder Wand Ranking timeline would look like for ODIs. If you haven’t read the linked post above, I’d probably recommend reading that first just to see how I went about deciding who takes the wand.

For those wondering what elder wand ranking means, in Harry Potter whoever disarms the person in possession of the elder wand they become the elder wand holder and are the only ones capable of wielding the wands true power. Translated to cricket, this means that you can only become the best country if you beat the best country in an ODI series, rather than accrue ICC ranking points (ugh boring). As a reader on my last post pointed out, this is similar to the Lineal Champion in Boxing.

This is different to the test cricket post because in that I only took winning away series into account, as that truly reflects an incredible achievement. Now I have to contend with ODI tournaments including the big one: The World Cup. I have decided to stay with the theme that only away series wins matter and losing a World Cup away from home doesn’t mean the incumbent team would lose the elder wand. *However*, if a team loses the World Cup at home they lose the wand but if they beat the team who goes on to win the trophy (in the group stage) then they would not lose the elder wand.

I have identified five periods:

· The large three dominance

· The 90s tournament scramble

· The Indo-Pakistan rivalry

· The Australian supremacy

· The ‘New England’ era

&amp;#x200B;

**The first period ‘The large three dominance’ runs from 1970 – 1992**

This was a strange period for ODIs where they were not really taken seriously. The large three of the time (notice how I didn’t say big three), which consisted of Australia, England and West Indies all held the elder wand in this period, and the West Indies held the title for the entirety of the 1980s. This starts with Australia taking the elder wand in the first ever ODI against England, although this was at home.

Australia. Australia in Australia 1-0 (1) 1970/71

England. England in Australia 1-0 (1) 1974/75

West Indies. West Indies in England 3-0 (3) 1976

Australia. Australia in West Indies 4-1 (5) 1990/91

\*In the 1975 World Cup in England, England did not play West Indies so did not lose the Elder Wand.

&amp;#x200B;

**The second period ‘The 90s tournament scramble’ runs from 1992 – 2001**

After a period of fews ODIs, the 1990s saw a period where we were up to our eyeballs in ODIs. The elder wand changed hand four times and they were all during global tournaments.

Pakistan. Pakistan in Australia (WC Group) 1992

Australia. Australia in Pakistan (Tri-series 2-1) 1994/95

Pakistan. Pakistan in Australia (Quad-series 3-1) 1996/97

South Africa. South Africa in Pakistan (Quad-series 1-0) 1997/98

\*The 1992 WC was in Australia/New Zealand, but Pakistan beat Australia in Melbourne

&amp;#x200B;

**The third period ‘The Indo-Pakistan rivalry’ runs from 2001 – 2007**

Australia took the wand in 2001, but after that, Pakistan and India wrestled for the wand in an ODI series nearly every year, which is strange considering these two titans now only meet in ICC events

Australia. Australia in South Africa 5-1 (7) 2001/02

Pakistan. Pakistan in Australia 2-1 (3) 2002

India. India in Pakistan 3-2 (5) 2003/04

Pakistan. Pakistan in India 1-0 (1) 2004/05

India. India in Pakistan 4-1 (5) 2005/06

&amp;#x200B;

**The fourth period ‘The Australian supremacy’ runs from 2007 – 2017**

Every time the elder wand changed hands in this period, Australia was involved. If they lost the wand, they reclaimed it almost immediately and held the wand at the end for nearly 7 consecutive years, which is the longest time since the West Indies in the 1980s

Australia. Australia in India 4-2 (7) 2007/08

India. India in Australia 3-2 (6) 2007/08

Australia. Australia in India 4-2 (7) 2009/10

Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka in Australia 2-1 (3) 2010/11

Australia. Australia in Sri Lanka 3-2 (5) 2011

\*2011 WC played in Sri Lanka but winners India only played Sri Lanka once and the game was held in India, So Sri Lanka do not lose the elder wand

&amp;#x200B;

**The fifth period ‘The ‘New England’ era’ runs from 2017 – present**

England ended Australia’s ODI dominance in 2018 with an emphatic victory, and recently held onto their title in the recently concluded World Cup. However, it is worth noting that if New Zealand had beaten England in the final, England would still retain the elder wand because they were 1-1 in that series as New Zealand had lost in the Group Stage

England. England in Australia 4-1 (5) 2017/18

12,What's the general consensus of the boundary rule.,"Let me preface this by saying I have nothing against England. According to the rules, they won fair and square. It is the rule which I want to discuss here. My opinion would be the same even if New Zealand were the beneficieries of the rule. 

Personally, I think the rule is ridiculous and the ICC has to come up with a different tiebreaker for the next ICC competitions. The boundary rule will be biased more often than not because some teams choose to score more of their runs through aggressive running, others decide to score more runs through boundaries. The boundary rule is also ridiculous because runs are runs whether they are scored through boundaries or through running. You get 4 runs for a four, you get 4 runs when you run four singles. Imagine an NBA game being decided the amount of 3 pointers one team scored. It is ridiculous.

14,A better tiebreaker for the next World Cup,"I think the ICC has to come up with a better tiebreaker for future events. I don't think the winner should be any event that has previously taken place. This discounts any methods such as boundaries, wickets, position in the table, head to head etc. I want to see a team actually win the final. Most major sports continue until there is an actual winner. 

My method would be not to have a whole other super over game, rather continue it in a way. So during the game, team A bats first, team B after, and their match is tied. In the super over, team B bats first and team A bats second. All of this is normal so far, but this is where it changes. Since the super over is tied as well, this means that team A comes out again, but they're not setting a target, the target is the same from the previous super over. If they make those runs, they win and if they don't they lose. In the case that this is a tie again, team B would come again and do the same as team A in the previous over. The same can't bowl back to back overs, and any dismissed batsmen cannot bat again.

How this would have played out in the final: After the tied super over, England would send 2 batsmen of their choice out again, both Stokes and buttler can come out again since they weren't dismissed. Their target is 16. Trent boult cannot bowl again, so new Zealand would have to pick another bowler. If England score the 16 they win, if they don't they lose. If they score 15 then New Zealand would come out to bat again. Guptill would not be able to bat as he was dismissed in the previous super over, and Jofra can't bowl again. In the rare case that that's also a tie, you just keep playing until a team wins.

I managed to stop before the floodgates broke loose. The store wasn't very busy this day so I didn’t get kicked out. After my session, I went to the restaurant inside IKEA and had some famous Swedish meatballs. The meatballs were subpar and gave me a slightly upset stomach. I didn’t think much of it, and I went back to shopping. I sat on the couch beat my meat and got off. This routine went on for a while because had high requirements for my couch. It had to be under 5000 dollars and the seat had to be comfortable for my bottom. It couldn’t be too prickly or too cold. After hours of wanking, I finally settled on a couch. The sofa was perfect. The seat was made out of smooth and thick fabric. I decided that I should reward myself and let it all out. It turns out that a lot of teasing can weaken a man’s penis and allow for a quick and far cumshot. I got cum all over the floor and the table that was sitting in front of the sofa. At this point, I had mixed emotions. I did not know if I should be proud f such a large cumshot or if I should be ashamed for making such a mess. The store was nearly abandoned, but one old couple walked by as I pulled my pants up. They saw the mess that I had made but did not assume that the white liquid was cum. The couple called management over to clean the mess because the couple wanted to buy the sofa as well. A couple workers came over to clean it up and asked what had spilled. I beat around the bush until the workers noticed that there were no cups or trash cans present near the sofa. Then one of the employees had a disgusted look on their face. The employees excused themselves to the corner of one aisle and had a discussion. The came back and asked, “sir is this your cum”. I was young and scared so I responded yes. Then the employee ran out and got the entire staff into the store. They got gloves and a mask and cleaned it all up. Then the manager came and checked the security camera footage. There I was with my phone on a porn website and beating my meat hard. The manager looked deeper into the camera footage and found that I had sat on all the couches butt-naked and jerked off. To make matters worse, one of the couches I had fapped on had a small turd on it that came from my meatballs earlier. The manager said that I had to pay for all the damn couches and that I was banned from all IKEAs. I was invited to his office to discuss plans to pay off the couches.

He suggests that it should have been Shakib Al Hasan because of his all round performance. I objected to that since Bangladesh came 8th and his performances provided no results in the context of the tournament. For me it’s either Sharma or Williamson but more the latter and I think a great example and comparison is Messi winning the player of the tournament in the 2014 World Cup.

35,The Bannerman Shield - A perpetual title for Test cricket,"I was scrolling through the list of Test series results on Statsguru the other day (as one does), and my mind was wandering to the idea of a perpetual title for Test cricket. Similar to the concept of a boxing World Championship where to become the champion you must defeat the champion. Such titles already exist for other sports; usually they remain unofficial like the [Unofficial Football World Championships (current holder: Germany)](https://www.ufwc.co.uk/) or the [Raeburn Shield for rugby (current holder: Wales)](http://www.raeburnshield.com/), but occasionally they are an actual real thing, like the [Raeburn Shield in New Zealand (current holders: Otago)](http://www.mitre10cup.co.nz/Competition/RanfurlyShield).

In the spirit of historically significant naming customs, I have called the perennial Test competition...

# The Bannerman Shield

[After Charles Bannerman, hero of the inaugural Test match](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/4091.html)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Rules of the Bannerman Shield**

1. All Bannerman Shield series take on the format of Champion versus Challenger.
2. In all series, the Champion shall be the home team and the Challenger the away team.
3. In order to retain the Shield, the Champion need only draw the Test series.
4. In order to take the Shield, the Challenger must win the Test series.

Without further ado, let us follow the history of the Shield from the very first Test to the present day.

After their defeat of South Africa in the Test series earlier this year, Sri Lanka have taken possession of the Bannerman Shield for the first time in their history. They became the sixth holders of the title after Australia (1879), England (1883), India (1971), West Indies (1975) and South Africa (2008). Despite extensive history in the Shield, New Zealand (since 1958), Pakistan (since 1964), Bangladesh (since 2003) and Zimbabwe (also since 2003) have not yet managed to claim the title. Afghanistan and Ireland have yet to be Challengers..

Heck, they are showing 'European cricket league' in 2 weeks, (which is essentially European club cricket) but not the t20 blast. I reckon the former was free to pick up or something.

Anyways how can we watch it legally here? Any of the gateway websites  that had legal rights to the IPL before Foxtel started showing it 2 years ago?",Cricket,1563411867,NamanMehra,5,8,True,2019-07-17
40,A question for England fans regarding Ashes selection,"There was a lot of talk this World Cup about selecting players based on their white-ball form. In the case of Roy, a first-class middle-order batsman, is it wise to do an Aaron Finch and put him up the top of the order against a swinging red Duke? It feels like you're setting the guy up to fail. After seeing how he was playing Boult and Henry in the final, with the white ball nipping about and making him look like a different player, I wonder if it's really a smart move. I guess it could end up being a masterstroke, or another Alex Hales situation.

Also, doesn't it kind of make performing well in the County Championship kind of irrelevant at this point, if the incumbent guys in the ODI and T20 outfits just get slotted in without doing the hard yards around the circuit putting the time in on red-ball cricket?

How do England fans feel about this? It's going to be a fascinating series from a neutral standpoint.",Cricket,1563412377,darkseid1988,11,4,True,2019-07-17

74,An Englishman made me fall in love with Test Cricket. What's your story?,"The dust has settled. The World Cup is over and England are the Champions. I may live in England now, but I was cheering for the Black Caps in what was a match that will live long in the memory for many reasons. The Ashes are just around the corner and now seems a fitting time as any to share how or why you came to fall in love with Test Cricket. For some sub, cricket is deeply ingrained into the national sporting culture, for others an Institution unto itself and for some people, cricket was something you stumbled upon in early adulthood or later. Regardless of when it happened, we probably all share the sentiment that it is a truly magical game.

For me, I was born towards the tail end of Apartheid South Africa. I was 4 years old when the 1992 World Cup took place. I have no recollection of the event, but I have vivid memories of going to the local public library to look at pictures of Rhodes running out Inzamam. My father would take me to watch local club cricket matches and watch Natal at Kingsmead. I had no shortage of potential heroes, but cricket was just another sport at the time, not something I could lose myself in. That was until England toured South Africa in 1995/6 and I was introduced to a certain batsman by the name of Michael Atherton.

Test 2 of 5 - Wanderers, Johannesburg
School holidays have started so I have nothing but free time. The match is being broadcast on SABC. Castle Lager adverts play throughout the series giving me a profound appreciation for Toto's 'Africa'. Hansie Cronje has just declared setting England a total of 479 in the 5 sessions left to play. By modern standards, this is not an easy chase, but in 1995, it is beyond the realms of possibility.

Commeth the Hour, commeth the Man. Atherton and Stewart (another I would come to appreciate in time) open the innings and I begin watching an attritional display of batting which has come to epitomise, for me, the Test Cricket experience. Donald, Pringle, Pollock &amp; McMillan is not something many batsman would look forward to. Donald was the 'White Lightning' and for good reason. Gorgeous bowling action that exuded raw pace. 1995 Pollock is not the Shaun Pollock we came to know towards the end of his career. This Pollock was more than capable of sending down 140+. McMillan loved to hit the deck, short and hard, a heavy ball, or so they say. Pringle was in the twilight of his career, playing in his last series and perhaps even his last test match, but had proven himself a canny bowler in the domestic scene for Province.

Atherton was at an added disadvantage. He could not duck under the short ball. It just wasn't in his kit. Sway out of the way, hook occasionally or get hit was the order of the day. He had (and still has I suppose) an arthritis of the spine. Donald was bouncing the man repeatedly. And on each occasion (or at least in my memory), Atherton would sway and give Donald a deadpan stare. I loved it. This tension was seething under the surface. Adults are weird. Why are they just glaring. England were not batting for the win and nor did I expect them to.  By the end of day 4, England were 160ish, with 4 back in the hut. Atherton alone, stood as a bastion against the onslaught. Finishing the day maybe 20 short of his century.

The dinner table that evening was filled with me regaling my father with the days events. My blossoming National pride beaming at the thought of winning the Test. I did my bit dad. I was there. I saw it. I was there on the couch cheering the Proteas on. Atherton wasn't ready to roll over just yet.

The morning of Day 5. I rose early to throw a tennis ball against the wall before quickly assuming a batting stance and blocking the ball by the time it had returned. Imaging the scenario of being a batsman coming out to save the Test on the last day. One of those imaginary lives you play out in your mind, and here I was being inspired by an Englishman.

Play started on Day 5 and when Atherton reached his century, it was a Durban boy who was batting with him, Robin Smith. When Smith was dismissed before lunch, it brought to the crease, that floppy hat wearing wicket-keeper/batsman, Jack Russell. It was the last time I would feel the surge of anticipation for impending victory. 

What followed for the remaining two sessions was two batsmen with the single minded goal of saving the Test. In Atherton and Russell were not in the zone, I certainly was! The courage. The mental strength. This...this is what Test Cricket feels like. Remember this feeling. No wicket fell between lunch and tea. I was reeling. A surge of conflicting emotions. Childlike overreactions of frustration and annoyance, coupled with a sense of awe. Michael Atherton. Dad had said he was boring. Dad said he could not play the short ball. Dad said a lot of things, Michael did a lot of things. Leaving, is doing something, I finally found myself thinking. Every ball you are not out, you have done something, especially in this context.

The post-tea session came and went. Where before tea I was more frustrated than inspired, now things feelings were trading places. Russell was holding up his end of the bargain, but Atherton was stealing the show. When the bails were tipped at the end of the day, England had come up 120 short. The draw had been secured and Atherton had finished his monster, 185 not out. 492 balls. 643 minutes. I had never seen an innings like it. Pure guts. I wasn't even mad. That blossoming National pride I spoke of previously, had been replaced with respect for an opponent who had left me speechless and had probably left 11 fielding Proteas deflated.

4 December 1995. The day I fell in love with Test Cricket. Aspects of it are as vivid as the bran flakes I had for breakfast. Others need to be filled in with the scorecard and conversations with my dad about that time. Regardless, Michael Atherton gave me something very special that day.

I thought I'd play around with putting together an XI of emerging stars - young players who played well and really made a name for themselves during the world cup.

However, all the other openers I could think of were either very experienced or quite crap this summer. Liton Das has had to move up the order to fill the vacancy!

Similarly Phehlukwayo was already quite well established before the WC but without him my team didn't have 50 overs between them. Given that he played really well in an otherwise struggling side, I decided he deserves to be there. The team is this:

126,Why We Need To Disentangle The Two Debates Around This WC Format,"And finally, this 1992-inspired league-style World Cup has come to an end. From 16 teams in 2007 and 14 in 2011 and 2015, this edition featured a measly ten sides. As the dust settles, what is the verdict on this everyone-plays-everyone format?

There are two distinct facets of the debate around this schedule. The first discusses the merits of the 10-team league format itself. The second argues against the very idea of a World Cup limited to just ten teams. Often, the defense of a larger, more inclusive tournament gets conflated with a criticism of the league stage itself. Concerned cricket fans desiring more teams on the biggest stage hurry to highlight the demerits of the league. It's important to disentangle the two arguments.

***

45 league games in one single round, and just 3 knockouts. Does this provide exciting cricket? The answer is heavily dependent on the quality and relative strength of the competing teams. Midway through the league stage, [the final 4 were almost decided](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,q_auto:good,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70befc27-43d2-40c2-bed5-eafae4a4a379_640x640.png). It was a series of stumbles by favorites England, and an inspired resurgence by Pakistan that made the fight for the 4th spot interesting. 

A big league is interesting only if a large chunk of teams are similarly placed, are equally strong or equally flawed. In the 2019 IPL, 4 teams scrambling for the final two positions made the latter stage interesting. A boring World Cup was given similar life in the middle stages. The point remains that this format could very easily have produced a World Cup full of dead rubbers. That the league heated up at the end was an artefact of the surfacing flaws of the top teams. 

Another point often used in favour of this format is that it ""rewards the best teams"". While that is true, there are multiple contradictions that need addressing. 

First of all, if the objective is sieving out the best team to crown them world champions, why have any knockout element at all? Why not just make the league topper the winners, or have a playoff system, or a series of knockouts? In this edition, the teams ranked 3 and 4 made it to the final. If the idea is to really reward the most consistent team, why should one bad day knock the top 2 out? So, this argument of ""best team"" is deflated by the tacking of knockouts onto the league. 

Now, if your answer is that knockouts are important to build excitement and give context, with the best teams playing each other in high pressure games, you've reached my next point. A World Cup needs context and excitement to each game, which are imposed externally through a structure of rounds. This structure of rounds should ideally ensure that almost every game is important (high pressure) and the best teams progress through and play each other. 

A bloated league stage which is the _only_ round doesn't do justice to a World Cup. The early games are too far away from the next round to really have excitement, and unless the mid table teams do well as some other teams falter, the final games become dead rubbers. In any case, relevance and pressure are infused into games through the presence of stages and immediate pathways for progression to the next stage. In this format, those discussions start only on the final third of the phase. 

(Russell Degnan has written on the potential excitement of formats [here](https://www.emergingcricket.com/insight/a-bad-format-associates-or-not/)). 

In any case, there already is a system to reward the best, most consistent side in a league-esque form: the ICC ODI rankings. This is now going to be formalised as the ODI Championship. The World Cup needs to be something else. 

With the format dissected, we must now address the elephant in the room. Should something called the World Cup have just ten teams? 

The first argument touted in support is that the ten ""best"" teams play, producing ""exciting"" cricket and fewer one sided matches. As [this](https://criconometrics.substack.com/p/15-minnows) excellent analysis shows, it turns out the while Full Member-Associate matchups _are_ indeed more one-sided, World Cup matches _in general_ have been won by heavy margins. 

(**Aside**: u/Mikolaj_Kopernik with an excellent essay destroying the argument against the inclusion of Associate / weaker teams [here](https://www.emergingcricket.com/insight/of-upsets-and-unpredictability-an-in-depth-analysis-of-odi-competitiveness/)). 

To add to this, the label of the ten ""best"" teams is arbitrary, since anyone of the lower ranked teams can beat any other on a given day. Scotland have bested Sri Lanka recently, and Ireland could beat Afghanistan in fast conditions. There is no fair way to determine which teams make the cut. There is also no guarantee that higher ranked teams put up a better fight all the time. South Africa and Pakistan got comprehensively beaten by India, while Afghanistan ran both India and Pakistan close. 

As the above linked essay concludes, considering data since the 2003 World Cup, Full Member-Associate Member games have a **36%** chance of upset if the ranking difference is within 3 places. The same figure for Full Member games is 41%: not a huge difference. 

***

A World Cup is the biggest showcase in cricket. It's a stage for everyone to perform against all others, and it holds within it the capacity to make heroes and change the whole game in a country. Ireland's win over Pakistan in 2007 set them off on the road to Test status, for instance. Not everyone competes to win the trophy, some just do it to show their mettle on the biggest stage. The benefit to their cricket in terms of experience, and to their fans at home as inspiration, is unquantifiable and magical. 

The pros and cons of the ten team round robin, in isolation, can be debated at length, but they should be irrelevant. Little moments of magic grow this glorious game, and a World Cup must promote this by including a fair number of teams. There's no better example than a motley crew of highly improbable winners on the Lord's balcony 36 years ago.

197,Surely the CWC final proves that England don't deserve to be called flat track bullies anymore,"If their multiple wins around the world weren't convincing enough, surely their win in the final proves that England don't deserve the title of 'flat track bullies'.

Even when they had the misfortune to lose the toss on a pitch from Williamson's wet dreams, they were still able to get stuck in and chase down a score that had been made when the pitch wasn't as dead a doornail. Throw in a bit of scoreboard pressure, as well as the fact that they were chasing in a bloody WC final, and it makes it all the more impressive.

Obviously they favour pitches which are good for batting and will thrive on them, but I think they've definitely proved beyond a doubt that the players hold the ability to adapt and overcome the conditions. Hell, two of their biggest tonkers of the ball, Stokes and Buttler were the two that built the partnership that brought England back from the brink, showing their ability to adapt to the conditions/situation. And even then, they still have Root who is only about one of the four best batsmen in the world.

Anyway it's 3am and this is kind of getting away from me but essentially the final and their multiple wins around the world for the past 4 years have shown that it does the England players a great disservice to call them flat track bullies.",Cricket,1563502222,SnazzyName683,17,0,True,2019-07-18

215,"Is it fair to claim that so long domestic leagues don’t become more prominent, have more funding and don’t have quotas, it will be very difficult to grow cricket in North America.","Ok so I’m new to the sport and admittedly don’t know as much as most of you guys, but hear me out.

Currently, unless you’re from a cricket playing nation there’s no viable career path in playing Cricket. Having a lucrative international career is out of the question, as unless you’re playing for a country where cricket is already established, there’s no money to be made. Currently cricket boards in North America just don’t have the income to pay their players well or even at all.

So we can deduce that in the early stages of growth, North American players will have to play in foreign domestic leagues. This has worked well fairly well in other sports. For example, even though Soccer isn’t traditionally very big in Canada, the ability to play in the MLS or Europe eventually has allowed Canadians to explore a career in soccer. Alphonso Davis is a prime example. The ability to pursue a career in the NHL just like any other Canadian or American has allowed hockey players from non traditional countries like Switzerland and Germany to succeed in the NHL. This you’re seeing hockey grow in these nations. I believe that even though banking your life on sports isn’t the wisest idea, when there is the ability to earn lots of money and succeed in a sport, more people will take that chance. Cricket doesn’t offer that at the domestic level.

The IPL is definitely a major league and for the length of the tournament, players do make a ton of money. However because there is a limit on the amount of foreign players on a team, this becomes limited to established superstars from established cricket playing countries opposed to promising from anywhere in the world. The IPL has however given opportunities to promising talent from India, and we’re seeing that with the likes of Bumrah for example. I think that if the IPL is able to rapidly expand and removes quotas, it would become easier and possible for North Americans to pursue a career in cricket.  A side effect of this could be that the tournament would now become a league and run year long. This would raise revenue for the league by having more matches as there are more teams and the league runs for longer, so it’s possible that it would offer even higher salaries than currently. The same applies to all other domestic leagues.

Another fringe point is the domestic leagues would likely be even more keen on growing the game than existing international boards. Time and time again we see domestic leagues in North America focus on growing the game to gain market share. The NBA for example played a preseason game in Mumbai just to grow the sport in India. International boards on the other hand often have other interests in mind. For example, the BCCI refuses to have cricket be played in the olympics even though it would likely grow the game.




I get that fans on this sub might not want the game to switch from traditional international series that focus on test and ODI matches to year long domestic T20 leagues andthat’s fine. There’re certainly problems with the switch, but I do believe that the fastest and best way to grow the sport in non traditional markets is by focusing on domestic leagues.",Cricket,1563513083,44th_King,3,11,True,2019-07-19
217,Recommendations from the ICC regarding the pace of play and slow over rates in international cricket,"* Captains will no longer be suspended for repeated or serious over rate breaches.
* All players should be held equally responsible for slow over rates, and as such will be fined at the same level as the captain.
* In World Test Championship matches a team that is behind the required over rate at the end of a match will have two competition points deducted for each over it is behind.

264,Australia's ODI all-rounder batting problem,"I think that this is a legitimate concern for Australia's team, and it has particularly been shown in this World Cup. Australia have brilliant bowlers such as Starc and Cummins, and brilliant batsmen such as Warner, Smith and Carey. However, their primary 2 all rounders were a bit of a concern when it came to their form this WC.

Generally, I've noticed that a lot of the successful teams have one or two good all-rounders (who are also usually good fielders) in their team (eg. England - Stokes and Woakes, India - Pandya and Jadeja, NZ- Neesham and maybe CDG?) 

One of these for AUS is Glenn Maxwell. While his fielding is obviously as good as ever, his form with the ball has been mediocre-average, and he hasn't been able to construct his innings well with the bat either, despite having a high strike rate. The other concern is Marcus Stoinis' form. He has often been targeted by the other team as he hasn't done the best job as the fourth pacer (although he has taken wickets), and he has been more of a liability with the bat that anyone on the team.

The reason this could hurt Australia's batting in the ODI format is that if the top order goes early, the all rounders will have to be the ones to bat through the rest of the innings. Although having Carey in the middle order does help that, he needs someone as a partner if it starts to get tough.

Smithy, mate, you made a mistake. Like, a really bad mistake. And I don't think anyone's going to let you forget it as long as you wear the baggy green.

Is that really what you want to be remembered for? Being captain during the biggest scandal ever to hit Australian cricket? I don't think so.

So how about you take your test average of 61 and come and play for England? I reckon we could find a spot for you in the middle order. Maybe even the one-day team if we have some injuries.

I've run the numbers, and England has a much higher population than Australia. It's got to be better having only 25 million people booing you rather than 55 million, don't you think? The maths checks out. Plus there's a much lower risk of being nearly castrated by Jos Buttler if you're playing on the same team. Everyone says we're doing a pretty good job of recruiting a World XI at the moment, so you'd fit right in.

343,Bowling tips: Ball slipping out of hand?,"22M, ""pace"" bowler. I've been trying to improve my bowling for the past couple of weeks - I was never very good but last week I felt that I'd really improved and I was able to at least reliably bowl a ball that would've been playable (not wide lol). The past two times I've been however, the balls have been all over the place. It feels like the ball is slipping out of my hand early in the delivery and flying somewhere miles away from the stumps. If I try to tighten my grip I hold onto it far too long and whack the ball into the ground a few metres in front of me. I don't know if it's just a fatigue thing (muscle soreness from the bowling) or something I can actually fix.

&amp;#x200B;

While no one has (or probably ever fully will) forgive him for it, I think that we should start to see him once again as the genuinely good cricketer that he is, and not ""Captain Sandpaper"". I'm just sick of hearing people discrediting him and his ability because of a mistake that he made in the past and that he won't repeat again. As I said, I do not approve of what he did, but I think the time has come for us to forgive Smith and move on.

This also applies to Warner (and Bancroft), but I feel like Smith took a lot of the hate as he was the captain.

We dropped a player who averages 40+ with 100+SR and has been specifically groomed for the past 3 years for the role based off one performance. And the replacement was DK. 

I also feel he won't be in contention for India anymore. Not only will there be some ill feelings between him and management but his viability for the future (next WC) is not the best given his age.

417,Things you need to know about Zimbabwe Cricket's suspension,"  

The International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Zimbabwe on Thursday after the country’s cricket board, Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC), was not able to hold out government's interference with the board's administration.

This is for the first time that a Full team has been suspended from participating in any form of cricket.

“We do not take the decision to suspend a Member lightly, however, we must maintain our game unfastened from political interference,” said ICC chairman Shashank Manohar. “What has befallen in Zimbabwe is a severe breach of the ICC Constitution and we cannot allow it to keep unchecked. The ICC wishes cricket to continue in Zimbabwe according to the ICC Constitution.”

After the International Cricket Council's (ICC) decision, cricketer Sikandar Raza said that it was now not how he wanted to say good-bye to cricket.

Raza posted on Twitter: ""How one decision has made a team, strangers, How one decision has made so many people unemployed, How one decision affects so many families, How one decision has ended so many careers, Certainly not how I wanted to say goodbye to international cricket. @ICC""

ICC has suspended various Associate Members in the past, Sri Lanka was on the verge of suspension in 2015 due to government interference, and Nepal is still under suspension. However, Nepal's countrywide teams have been allowed to continue taking part in ICC events at some point of suspension, similarly even America in the course of their latest suspension and expulsion duration from June 2015 thru January 2019 took part in ICC occasions.

462,Test Cricket - Impact of toss,"It has been frequently alluded to on the sub that in the last few years, we've begun to see the toss have a disproportionate impact on the game. I've tried to do an analysis of the impact of the results on the toss on the Test results in the last few years. My assumptions are:

1. I've only considered Test matches
2. I've only considered Tests in the last 2 years (1st July, 2017 onwards). This is just an arbitrary selection on my part since I'm too lazy to go through more historical data
3. I've calculated loss% instead on win% just because some draws were skewing results. Raw data is also included so win % can be easily estimated
4. The cancelled NZ-Ban match is included as a draw.
5. I've only done the analysis for Aus, Ban, Eng, Ind, NZ, Pak, SA, SL and Windies. The matches played by these teams against Afg, Zim and Ire are included but the analysis has not been done for those teams.
6. UAE is considered as home ground for Pak for most analysis

The table below gives the raw data for the various teams in terms of matches played at home and away, tosses won home and away and matches won home and away.

&amp;#x200B;

[Raw data for results of tosses and matches](https://i.redd.it/8p4k8jd53ib31.png)

I then proceeded to calculate who the ""lucky"" teams were, who won the most tosses.

&amp;#x200B;

[Tosses won by teams](https://i.redd.it/16n9t55f3ib31.png)

Apparently, Australia win a very low % of the tosses (get better tossers as captains, Aussies!) and Eng and NZ win a very high % of theirs. England's statistic is probably not surprising for Aussie, Indian and SL fans given how many tosses Joe Root won apparently on the trot! But this is only trivia. The more interesting statistic, is what impact winning the tosses had. The following is the loss % of teams after \*winning\* the toss:

&amp;#x200B;

[Loss &amp;#37; after winning the toss](https://i.redd.it/ofjvhy044ib31.png)

India and NZ have not lost a match in the last 2 years after winning the toss - neither home nor away. Aus, SL and Pak have not lost a home match after winning the toss. In total, 26 matches have been lost by the winner of the toss out of a total of 91 Tests played in the last 2 years - i.e. only 28.5% of the total matches played have been lost by the side winning the toss. This statistic is skewed by matches between Ireland, Zimbabwe and the older Test playing teams - 3 matches. Excluding them, it is a total of 23 matches lost by the winner of the toss out of 88 Tests played - i.e. only 26.1% of the winners of the toss in a match between evenly matched teams lose the match.

I also looked at the converse picture. How many teams losing the toss have won the match? The loss % are given in the table below:

&amp;#x200B;

[Loss &amp;#37; after losing the toss](https://i.redd.it/ame5055e6ib31.png)

The away loss % after losing the toss make for a pretty sorry reading for most teams. The standout performer is SL who lose only \~29% of their away matches even after losing the toss. Conversely, their loss % on losing the toss at home is fairly shabby. NZ, India and Windies have not lost a match at home during the last 2 years despite losing the toss. Away teams have lost the toss on 55 occasions in the last 2 years and they've lost 39 of those matches - a loss % of \~71%. Away teams have won the toss on 43 occasions and they've lost 18 of those matches - a loss % of \~42%. A compiled summary of loss % of home and away teams after winning and losing the toss is below.

&amp;#x200B;

[Loss &amp;#37; overall home and away](https://i.redd.it/3zte0itkcib31.png)

In line with obvious popular opinion, when an away team loses the toss, they lose the match 70% of the time and when a home team wins the toss, the lose only 17% of the time.

I also looked to see if matches in some countries were more affected by the results of the toss. The following is the impact of the toss by geography:

[Geographic impact of the toss](https://i.redd.it/yl4itfnmeib31.png)

This table is slightly misleading because it gets skewed by various factors. India and Australia winning most games at home regardless of the toss makes it appear as though the toss has no impact on these countries while it may just be because of the home advantage. On first glance, it might appear that the toss has a huge impact on matches in England. But these numbers are skewed because England win an insane % of their tosses at home so it is difficult to distinguish whether it is the home advantage of the toss advantage leading to the win %. It is apparent, however, that the toss has a huge impact in SL, Ban and UAE. In the last 2 years, in SL, only 1 match has been won by the team losing the toss - SL (home team) won against Zim. No team has won a match in the UAE after losing the toss in the last 2 years. Even in Ban, only 1 match was won by the team losing the toss - Aus beat Ban.

In general, the toss has a disproportionate impact on matches between evenly matched teams and it will be interesting to trial methods whereby such advantages are negated.

465,My favourite world cup matches,"I fell in love with cricket during the 1996 world cup, and I've enjoyed watching every subsequent edition. I thought it would be nice to compile a list of my favorite matches by WC. Here are mine, please post yours in the comments!


1996: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/65190/india-vs-sri-lanka-1st-sf-wills-world-cup-1995-96. This semifinal saw transcendent strokeplay by Aravinda De Silva and wily left-arm spin bowling by the underrated Jayasuriya on display; simply wonderful cricket on the biggest stage. Some shocking behavior from the unruly crowd meant that the Sri Lankans were not allowed to administer the last rites to their supine opponents.


1999: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/65230/india-vs-new-zealand-8th-super-icc-world-cup-1999. This underrated classic from the 99 WC saw some miserly medium pace from Chris Cairns (whose career took a sad turn later...) to snuff out their opponent's middle order, and a perfectly paced chase, masterminded by the unheralded Roger Twose. A match that perfectly embodied the nature of one-day cricket in the 90s.

An all-time great knock by Ricky Ponting and a much-overlooked classic by Damien Martyn led to the highest total in a world cup final, and a ruthlessly efficient bowling performance headlined by the excellent McGrath delivered the coup de grace and knocked the stuffing out of their opposition.


2007: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/247464/bangladesh-vs-india-8th-match-group-b-icc-world-cup-2006-07. In many ways, the performance that heralded the arrival of Bangladesh on the biggest stage. An excellent bowling effort led by Mashrafe Mortaza, followed by an unforgettable assault by Tamim Iqbal that knocked the feet out from under their much-fancied opponents.


2011: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/433586/india-vs-south-africa-29th-match-group-b-icc-cricket-world-cup-2010-11. A classic in the sweltering heat of Nagpur. A typically incisive burst by Dale Steyn led to a chase-able total, which South Africa hauled down with precision in a perfect chase that was anchored by a vintage knock by Jacques Kallis, and bolstered by a mercurial innings by AB De Villiers.


2015: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/656493/australia-vs-india-2nd-semi-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2014-15. A typically clinical performance by the Aussies in a high-pressure home semifinal. Steve Smith stood up for his team when it counted with a perfectly paced century, and Mitchell Johson, at the peak of his powers, sliced through a storied top-order that delivered the match to Australia on a platter.


2019: https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/1144528/india-vs-new-zealand-1st-semi-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019. An instant classic. New Zealand battled rain interruptions and a sluggish pitch to post a competitive total, with their best batsmen, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor, putting their hands up when it mattered. An inspired burst by Trent Boult and Matt Henry, and electric fielding by the whole team, saw New Zealand clinically defend the total and advance to their second world cup final.",Cricket,1563654004,fookinlegend2,6,0,True,2019-07-20

477,A comparison of Australia's Ashes batting hopefuls,"There are two issues with comparing raw FC numbers in Australia:

1. The youth policy
2. Some players have played a lot of Test cricket, some have played none

We can rectify both of these by comparing players on a level field. In this instance here is a table of the current Australia hopefuls, from their 23rd birthday onwards, in FC outside Tests:

Player	|	Age	|	Mat	|	Inns	|	Runs	|	Ave	|	100s	|	50s
:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--	|	:--

Note that Pucovski is not on this list as he is not 23 years of age. An interesting point here is that comparing the three main incumbent's Test average to the above average reveals that this could well be a decent measure. Warner (50.07 compared to 48.20), Smith (60.20 compared to 61.37) and Khawaja (43.73 compared to 42.53). That said, Mitch Marsh and Shaun Marsh do not fit this pattern particularly well. 

On the above, the best XI for Australia for the Ashes would be:

1. Warner
2. Harris
3. Khawaja
4. Smith
5. Head
6. Wade

With Handscomb or Labuschagne coming in if Khawaja is injured. 

Assuming that Shaun Marsh isn't in contention. This is very similar to the general feeling around the place. 

Of the players here, the two young guns of their day, Patterson and Burns both don't look overly impressive. This isn't surprising as both had slumps in their mid 20s, part of the reason they've struggled for selection. 

This isn't meant to be a replacement to other judgement of course, but rather a different perspective on the players in contention. 

For the record, my personal side for this Ashes would be:

1. Warner
2. Burns
3. Khawaja
4. Smith
5. Head
6. Patterson

With Harris coming in to open and Burns to 3 if Khawaja is unavailable. I'd suggest this on the basis that Burns and Patterson have been impressive in their Test careers so far, and that Patterson has shown a particular characteristic that is useful for us at 6; whilst generally unimpressive, he's generally always still getting 50s. I suspect the side I suggested from the list will be closer to the side for the first Test however.",Cricket,1563665797,Anothergen,37,12,True,2019-07-20

The World Games are the lesser-known cousin of the Olympics, featuring sports that are not in the Olympics. This includes sports like karate, billiards, powerlifting and korfball, as well as the quirkier orienteering, dance sport, and finswimming. Several sports (badminton, taekwondo, triathlon, women's weightlifting) debuted in the World Games before being promoted to the Olympics. Others, like tug of war, moved back from the Olympics into the World Games.

The next two World Games are in Birmingham, Alabama (2021) and Chengdu, China (2025).

What’s best, the *federations* of these sports are members of the International World Games Association (IWGA). So cricket could become a part of the World Games without ICC or any national body losing control.",Cricket,1563679425,soleil_bleu,15,47,True,2019-07-20

Even till the last ball was bowled, they batted with intended. It's good to have 'Q' (qualified) on the points table now. This will keep us in a good frame of mind going into the semi-finals. (Five bowlers) Look, we experienced that Hardik when put under pressure has come back really well. He's really looking forward to do stuff for the team. He has a gut feel of what the batsman is looking to do. I know five bowlers was a gamble, but it was keeping in mind the ground dimensions. We wanted to play the perfect combination for the small boundary. (On Rohit) I have been watching it for years now. He's the best One-day player around and we are so delighted to see him. When he plays like that, everybody is happy to see him strike this so well. (On Bumrah) His overs were always going to be crucial, so that's why we stopped him after four initially. He's a world-class bowler and he just knows what he's up against. We can look to capitalise on situations where we are in a position to score those extra 30 runs. Very happy with the way the team has played so far. Thank you - the fans have been magnificent.""

*******************************************************************************

**Mashrafe Mortaza:** ""This was a good effort, but we had to win this match. (On partnerships) If one of them could have been 80-90, it could have been a different match, but 47-50 is asking a bit much. We could have had a bit more luck, but Shakib Al Hasan has been in superb form, and Mushfiq has batted beautifully. Rohit's catch was obviously disappointing, but those things happen in the field. (On Pakistan game) We have played our best, and fans have been fantastic. Hopefully we will end on a good note.""

*******************************************************************************

**Player of the match is Rohit Sharma:** ""I had a great feeling right at the start. It's a great pitch to bat on. The first game against South Africa, I had to take my time. Against England as well, the pitch was two-paced, and they used the conditions really well. There was no question of scoreboard batting first, so that's what I had to do. I was lucky (early on)...fortune favours the brave. I never think about the shorter boundaries when I bat, because my game is all about piercing the field. Once you are set, the idea is to put pressure on the bowlers. (Four hundreds in one World Cup) Oh I thought I just got a 100 today. My mantra is whatever has happened in the past is in the past. Those in form have to bat long and get the team to a big score. I need to focus on the next game now.""",Cricket,1562090028,ghemanth90,491,262,True,2019-07-02

Perhaps the biggest takeaway for Bangladesh from this world cup is the earmarking of their best ever - their king maker - Shakib Al Hasan among the greatest cricketers of all time. A validation that has come perhaps a bit late, one that has come on back of the greatest individual performance in a world cup, but one that was destined to arrive nonetheless.

Country     | Points | Net Run Rate
------------|--------|-------------
New Zealand | 11     | +0.572
England     | 10     | +1
Pakistan    | 9      | -0.792


#### Scenario 1

If England win and NZ don't lose too badly i.e. NZs net run-rate doesn't become -ve, how much run (batting first) would Pakistan have to defeat Bangladesh to qualify. Or, how many wickets do they have to win by (in how many over) to qualify.

Unless NZ get absolutely WRECKED by England and Pakistan absolutely WRECKS Bangladesh the only way we have a shot is if NZ beat ENG tomorrow.

Fuck I knew that West Indies game was going to haunt us, it wasn’t that we lost it was how bad we lost. We were never going to recover the net RR.

Edit: Because I’m a desperate Pakistani at this point if NZ lose to ENG by 200 runs and we beat BNG by 200 we still DON’T qualify on RR. We need NZ to beat ENG tomorrow.

67,"England Cricket has gone through a host of changes since the 2005 Ashes, who would you pick in your English sides of the last 15 years if everybody was available to you for selection, and at their peak?","Since the 2005 Ashes, England has gone through a lot of structural changes and also probably the only team who regularly has so many different players coming into the sides and had 3 sides for the most part, looking fairly different from each other. 

So if you had to pick the best possible English teams over the last 15 years, who would you pick and why? Where would your balance come from. I know horses for courses is important so feel free to tell me who you’d replace for who if the conditions play a factor in selection. 

The following lists are completely my opinion and I’d love to hear yours! 
Let’s discuss!

Test Cricket: 

1. Andrew Strauss (C)
2. Alistair Cook 
3. Kevin Pietersen (part timer) 
4. Joe Root (part timer)
5. Ian Bell 
6. Ben Stokes (4th seam option)/Paul Collingwood (medium pacer)
7. Andrew Flintoff (3rd seamer) 
8. Matt Prior (WK) 
9. Graeme Swann 
10. Stuart Broad (2nd seamer)
11. James Anderson (1st seamer/night watchman).

I’d have ideally wanted Jonathan Trott at his peak in that lineup but his career was a weird one with how good he was when he started off, he just completely fell apart towards the end of it. It was short. Although understandable, I still feel the others on this list would’ve been better. Also, Stokes to me is more dynamic than Collingwood but at the same time when Collingwood was batting, it just felt like it was 1920 and all of a sudden you’d stop to watch him calmly go about his business. It was a good feeling. I’d also probably want to play Monty in there if you’re playing in the sub continent but i really don’t know who to replace because the team is stacked. 

One Day Internationals:

1. Jason Roy 
2. Johnny Bairstow 
3. Joe Root 
4. Eoin Morgan (C) 
5. Ben Stokes 
6. Jos Buttler 
7. Andrew Flintoff 
8. Chris Woakes 
9. Adil Rashid
10. Jofra Archer/Bresnan. 
11. James Anderson 

James Anderson is on there for the simple fact that he’s taken way too many wickets to be left out of it, id swap him out for Moeen when you’d require an extra spin option. Also, I’m not quite sure how KP would make that list so I left him out as well. I’d have loved to have KP for example after Roy got injured this World Cup because all of a sudden there’s no injury depth to cover for him and England was stuck playing with Vince who for the most part has been a One Day Nick Compton. Included Jofra in there because even though he’s just begun playing for England, he’s shown enough quality as compared to the others to have played as a first seamer in ODIs for England. 

T20 Internationals:

1. Jason Roy 
2. Alex Hales 
3. Kevin Pietersen 
4. Joe Root (C)
5. Ben Stokes 
6. Jos Buttler 
7. Luke Wright 
8. Chris Woakes 
9. David Willey
10. Adil Rashid 
11. Tim Bresnan 

Too many options here to choose from, Craig Keiswetter had to retire early, Lumb came in too late, Napier barely featured and Bopara just lost out to Luke Wright, who I would prefer over Bopara specially with the bat. I couldn’t find a slot for Collingwood who took England to victory in the world t20 but I can’t see him getting picked ahead of Stokes.",Cricket,1562101682,harshmangat,13,8,True,2019-07-02

It's pretty much been beaten to death imo and it's an issue that we have to live with just like other top teams (NZ over-reliant on Williamson-Taylor, ENG and PAK's inconsistency, AUS being a slightly better version of us with their tendency to choke at the death after a good start).

Yet, when any of these teams win regardless of the way they did it, their fans on this sub are genuinely happy and appreciate them but all we do is shit on them or downplay the win saying we won off a dropped catch or a Bumrah over or in spite of Dhoni/Jadhav/Shankar. Look at Pak flairs on Pak v Afg, NZ flairs on NZ v WI, and then look at ours vs Afg and Bang.

I mean we're 6-1 ffs and have been put in all kinds of situations this WC (low chase, high chase that failed, defending a low total, defending a high total) so we must be doing something right. We don't even have the luxury of ICC Dhawan here. Enjoy the wins instead of being overly pessimistic of our chances at the trophy or extremely critical of the team all the time. It's almost like living your entire life fearing death. Knockout games favor whoever plays the best cricket that day, and if it's not us, so be it. If we win the cup, you guys are gonna regret all this negativity, and if we get knocked out, you're gonna be left with nothing to cheer for, so enjoy while it lasts.

Lastly, being passionate doesn't excuse you of the pure vitriol some of you spew in match threads. I'd like to think it's just because there are a lot of Indians, but even some of the saner fans here agree with and upvote this trash. When Munro, Finchy or Hash fail, everyone shitposts and trolls them. You guys can do the same for our players when they don't perform to expectations. Lots of us come here away from FB and Twitter, yet the match thread comments at that pace and even some of the posts that bash players here are only marginally better.",Cricket,1562102007,cantfindusernameomg,230,1048,True,2019-07-02

Joe Burns has just announced he would return to cricket after being cleared from suffering a chronic fatigue disorder, and has been rushed back to the A squad. Wade has been absolutely dominating in the one-day games, so maybe CA have realised that he’d prove them wrong either way, and they’ve devised another secret plan?

99,An analysis of Dhoni by an amateur,"I wanted to discuss Dhoni's performances in the world cup. If we go by first impressions, my impression of Dhoni would still be a fearless hitter - which of course can't be farther from the truth today. But where did that quality go?

We all saw Dhoni morphing into this responsible finisher from the hitter that he was. Yesterday I saw an innings from early in his career. It was painful to watch - because I was watching this on my phone as the (Ind vs BD) match was running on my TV. 

It really looks like he has over the years, overcompensated being a finisher - now he just wants to make sure that he doesn't lose his wicket before the last ball is bowled. Even when the situation demands some hitting, he doesn't hit unless he is absolutely sure of not getting out. I think we can all agree - the intent to hit isn't there. It just isn't.

When someone tells me that I am not good at something - I can afford to feel insecure and give it up. Feel sorry for myself. He cannot - he plays for India. It would be naive of me to say that he doesn't realize his liability as a batsman. I can't be sure, but I get the feeling that he does realize it. I have read articles that he is immune to criticism because he insulates himself very well from it - but I sometimes can't fathom how he could be happy with himself with his batting - as a result, I wonder if it is painful for the man himself to bat every match? I don't know. 

My cricketing brain is probably less than 1% of his and I can never really criticize his tactics or his instincts on the field. As many have said on this sub, he is still very valuable to the team on a tactical basis. 

He has played for India since 2005 (Dec 2004 to be precise) - that's almost 15 years. 15 years that the team is habituated with his tactics, his intelligence and his ability to read the situation. 

He cannot just hang up his boots today - his team needs to become independent of his influence. It would probably take the time span between two world cups to build a whole new team without Dhoni's influence. Just look at ABDs retirement (not to blame him - completely different circumstances) and what it did to SA this world cup. 

Had he retired after the 2015 world cup, things may have been different - but he didn't. He believed he could perform the same way right until 2019 - but he couldn't. We can all wait for him to retire after this world cup. I only hope that my thoughts above are somewhere close to the truth and he allows India to prepare well for the world cup in 2023. 

Until then, I will be as usual, in my fantasy land, waiting for that last match winning innings with which he can go out with a bang and get India across the line in this WC.",Cricket,1562117453,usrname_is_taken,23,3,True,2019-07-02

The only memorable performance of his that comes to mind is his 29 runs against Bangladesh in the Nidahas Trophy.

He failed to perform in the New Zealand tour earlier this year and other than the 97\* in the IPL, had no other performances that seemed to earn his selection in the World Cup Squad.

124,India must pick Mayank Agarwal against Srilanka,"It isnt even debatable that our middle order has been average at best throughout the world cup.

And that with Dhawan out injured we are missing the attacking impetus to capitalize on the first power play. Rahul has done a decent job as opener but he is cautious when starting just like Rohit.

The best solution for both these issues is to give Mayank Agarwal a go at the top. Then we can drop Rahul no.4 position and Pant to no.5 Pandya at 7 and our middle order looks lot stronger even with Dhoni struggling.

This also means we have an attacking opener at the start to capitalize on power play as Agarwal usually goes above 100SR in domestics.

And we dont even need to worry about his temperament. He already showed he isnt fazed by the occasion or the quality of bowlers when he made debut in the boxing day test against Australia last year.

And Srilanka are an ideal opposition (Now that we have qualified) to shuffle the batting order before knock outs.

Only slight negative is that we may not have 6th bowling option (Kohli and Agarwal are at best ok part timers) but Pandya has proven himself as a quality 5th bowler . So we shouldn't really worry that much about it imo.

Another added advantage with this is that Rahul has had lot of time in the middle and in decent form so for once our middle order wont be going into the knockouts undercooked.

We should go with this XI for Srilanka

Rohit

Agarwal

Kohli

Rahul

Pant

Dhoni

If England beats NZ today, then NZ and Pak would end up on 11 points each if Pak beats Bangladesh. NZ potentially gained 1 extra point by tying with India and Pak potentially lost 1 point.

In case of SL, if they manage to beat India, and Eng lose to NZ, then both Eng and SL would end up on 10 points but Eng would go through because of more number of wins. Imagine the outrage if this was the other way around and one of the Big 3 teams was missing out because of Rain. (SL's NRR is also worse, so it kind of mitigates the effect in this game).

Finally, if India had beaten NZ, they could've finished first and could have had an easier opponent in the Semis. There was little to choose from between India and Aus in the group stages and Aussies were beneficiaries of no rains to top the group. An IPL style eliminator would have rewarded the consistent teams like Aus and India.

237,"Calling fans of India and Pakistan - let's have it, boys. Let's do this one more time","It's  been stinking out there in the media, particularly in social media, ever since India, allegedly, threw their match vs England to see that Pakistan are knocked out. The whole situation's been like India developed cold feet about a possible knock-out encounter with the arch-rivals, especially on seeing that Pakistan have started to get their act together after getting a stiff kick in the butt from fans and media back home, or from sheer mal-intent (intent, oh yeah), if not all that. With CT17 Final still fresh in memory, all this talk on the topic is obvious and expected. Now, this means one thing and one thing only - there's **unfinished business**. Yes. India and Pakistan have unfinished business, and that needs to be settled, settled for good.

Now, should it happen, should things fall in place, for India it will be a chance to reassert their dominance over Pakistan in the WCs, to avenge their CT17 Final loss and bring cheer back home; for Pakistan, it'll be an opportunity to prove to the world that they're never to be underestimated, that all their shortcomings notwithstanding they're the ones with whom lies the X factor.

All this only if things fall in place for Pakistan in the next few days, or it'll be a case of talking too soon. Only time will tell.

246,Rayudu retires from all forms of cricket,"&amp;#x200B;

[Rayudu's decision comes after he was overlooked as a replacement player for Vijay Shankar at the 2019 World Cup](https://i.redd.it/gs2p14ndg2831.jpg)

Middle order batsman Ambati Rayudu announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Wednesday (July 3). The 33-year-old Rayudu represented India in 55 One day Internationals, scoring 1694 runs at an average of 47.05 and featured in six T20Is too. Rayudu has also had a long IPL career - representing two of the most successful franchises in Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings.

""I would like to bring to your kind notice that I have come to decision to step away from the sport and retire from all forms and levels of the game. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the BCCI and all the state associations that I have represented which include Hyderabad, Baroda,Andhra and Vidharbha,"" he said in a statement.

""I also would like to thank the two ipl franchises MI and Csk for their support. It has been a honour and privilege to have represented our country. I would like to thank the captains i have played under, MS Dhoni, Rohit sharma and especially Virat kohli who always had shown great belief in me throughout my career with the Indian team.

""It has been a wonderful journey of playing the sport and learning from every up and down it brought up on for the last 25 years at various different levels. Finally I would like to thank my family and all the wellwishers who have been with me throughout this wonderful journey.""

Rayudu was expected to be in the initial World Cup squad as the No.4 batsman but his dwindling form leading up to the tournament put him out of favour. Vijay Shankar took his place in the squad, leaving Rayudu in a bit of a limbo as he'd recently retired from first-class cricket to concentrate on his white-ball form ahead of the World Cup.

Rayudu's decision comes after he was overlooked as a replacement player following Vijay Shankar's injury. India had called up Rishabh Pant to replace Shikhar Dhawan earlier in the tournament, while the team opted to bring in Mayank Agarwal as Vijay's replacement.",Cricket,1562149988,judebenny,0,0,True,2019-07-03
257,Qualification Math for New Zealand,"**These scenarios purely deal with the case where NZ lose today and what would need to happen for them to be knocked out of the world cup.**

&amp;#x200B;

The math became simpler now that NZ are batting second. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Scenario 1 : Pakistan also bat first in their last match.***

If England score 350 NZ lose by say 100 runs, they would end up with an NRR of 0.2478.

In that case, assuming Pakistan bat first and score 350, would need to win their last match by a margin of 338 runs. Basically they will need to bowl out Bangladesh for 12 runs or less. Any score less than 337 for Pakistan would mean they would not even has a theoretical chance of cross NZ.

&amp;#x200B;

The net margin (Loss Margin of NZ in this match + Win margin for Pak in the next) should be greater than about 440 runs. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Scenario 2 : Pakistan bat second in their last match***

Pakistan bowl first and Bangladesh make 200 runs and score the theoretical maximum (206 runs) to win the match.

Pakistan would need to finish the match in the following number of overs depending on the margin of loss for NZ.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/644w4vzxm2831.png

Hence, for all intents, if England win today, Pakistan only have an academic chance. If England win today by a margin smaller than about 160 runs and Pakistan bat second against Bangladesh, they will not even have an academic chance of qualifying.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story : KIWI's are safe for the semi-finals and it would really require a four horsemen of the apocalypse kind of a scenario for them to be knocked out by Pakistan.",Cricket,1562152395,admadguy,35,79,True,2019-07-03

297,India XI for Srilanka match. Should Mayank Agarwal get his debut ?,"It isnt even debatable that our middle order has been average at best throughout the world cup.

And that with Dhawan out injured we are missing the attacking impetus to capitalize on the first power play as well. Rahul has done a decent job as opener but he is cautious when starting just like Rohit.

The best solution for both these issues is to give Mayank Agarwal a go at the top. Then we can drop Rahul no.4 position and Pant to no.5 Pandya at 7 and our middle order looks lot stronger even with Dhoni struggling.

This also means we have an attacking opener at the start to capitalize on power play as Agarwal usually goes above 100SR in domestics.

And we dont even need to worry about his temperament. He already showed he isnt fazed by the occasion or the quality of bowlers when he made debut in the boxing day test against Australia last year.

And Srilanka are an ideal opposition (Now that we have qualified) to shuffle the batting order before knock outs.

Only slight negative is that we may not have 6th bowling option (Kohli and Agarwal are at best ok part timers) but Pandya has proven himself as a quality 5th bowler . So we shouldn't really worry that much about it imo.

Another added advantage with this is that Rahul has had lot of time in the middle and in decent form so for once our middle order wont be going into the knockouts undercooked.

Will give Chahal and Bumrah a rest before knock outs as there is only a 2 day gap between Srilanka match and QF on Tuesday .

We should go with this XI for Srilanka

However, if they field first, then things appear more manageable for them. They need to score at a run rate that is 6.32 more than Bangladesh's run rate. For instance, if Bangladesh get bowled out for 150, then Pakistan must chase it down with a run rate of 9.32, or 16.1 overs.

445,How Pakistan can win by fielding first,"Step 1: Let Bangladesh score about 600 runs

Step 2: Score 599 in the 20 overs

Step 3: Hope that it rains heavily at that moment and no more legal deliveries can be bowled

Now, the DLS par score after 20 overs would be less than 240, and Pakistan would win by 360 runs thereby qualifying for the Semis.

If there's no DLS in play and Pakistan is batting second, there's no chance they can qualify for the semis because of how NRR is calculated. The calculations involve ((total runs scored by you across the tournament / overs played by you) - (total runs scored against you across the tournament / overs played against you)). The advantage you get by batting second is the overs played against you is calculated as 50 even if the team got all out before that, but overs played by you is calculated to be the overs you took for scoring the winning runs. Here even if Bangladesh scores 0 and Pakistan chases it on a first ball no ball, the NRR increase due to denominator of second term increasing by 50 and first term remaining the same is not enough for Pakistan's NRR to exceed New Zealand's",Cricket,1562178664,hornybanana69,5,13,True,2019-07-03

Pakistan and Bangladesh were very unlucky to miss out on a point vs SL. Both of them would have beaten SL on most days. It should have been 10-10 now, with Pakistan to play BD in a virtual quarter final for the final spot. Imagine the atmosphere, fan support, noise at the Lords on Friday!! That would have been cracker of a match to watch as a neutral fan. They are both playing better cricket than NZ at this time.

But more importantly New Zealand is playing terrible cricket, and just don’t look a par side. They rely heavily on Williamson, Boult and Fergusson. They seem to be going through the motions in last few games. They don’t have much fan base and atmosphere during their games feels a bit gloomy. I know it is what it is, but the rain interference sucks and has robbed the world cup from mouth watering prospect of PAK-BD quarterfinal, and even more tempting possibility of IND-PAK game in SF or Final. 

I hope NZ get Munro back to attack the Aussies at top, Fergusson is fit, they drop ineffective Santner for Sodhi, and Taylor finds some big hitting form. I hope they play with some swagger to upset the Aussies and hand them their first semi final loss ever.

Otherwise it's incredibly premature and quite honestly rude to assume that we aren't capable enough of handling the top teams. After all, we are ranked bloody 3rd in the world in ODI's. I just hate how everyone thinks we suck against the top teams, when noone realises how competitive we've been over the years. Barring Hindustan's drubbing of us recently at home, we've beaten the Aussies in 2 of the last 3 ODI series we've played against them, had a highly competitive bilateral ODI series against England and South Africa where we lost 3-2 to both, and demolished Pakistan the last time they toured here.

I believe TMS is usually broadcast on Longwave and digital radio but there is a special FM broadcast (on 62.3MHz apparently) at the grounds that the clip on radios tune into.

62,Subreddit traffic stats for the start of the World Cup,"Given some recent popular matches and the World Cup going on thought some people might be interested in seeing the current traffic stats for the subreddit and some numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

[This image shows traffic in recent months\/weeks](https://i.redd.it/fvsoo074u0531.png)

Some info from reddit on this:

&gt;Pageviews and uniques include activity on the desktop site, the mobile website shown to users on phones and tablets, and the official iOS and Android apps. We currently do not count pageviews and uniques from 3rd party clients. 

So actual numbers would be even higher with all the 3rd party apps being used, which would account for a lot of views.

Fair to say things have certainly been busy lately. A few highlights from the numbers:

* 180k unique visitors during India-Pakistan, with just over 1.2 million pageviews, and 1800 new subscribers (1700 of which were probably alts).
* This was the busiest day in a long time, but not by a huge margin. There were more new subscribers (2200) on the 31st, the day after the tournament started. No doubt nudged along by r/cricket being named as a trending subreddit for that day in response to the big traffic increase for the opening match (150k uniques for the opening).
* Total subscriber increase since the tournament start is currently about 14k, or around a 13% increase in size in just over two weeks. 

So far the highest traffic days have been:

* 30th: Eng v SA opening match
* 31st: Pak v WI and r/cricket named a trending subreddit
* 5th: SA v Ind
* 6th: Aus v WI
* 9th: Ind v Aus (150k uniques, 1 mill pageviews, 1500 subscribers)
* 12th: Aus v Pak 
* 16th: Ind v Pak

And for interest, this is a rough breakdown of subreddit unique visitors by the platform they're using:

* New reddit: 17-20%
* Old reddit: 9-16%
* Mobile web: 15-25%
* Reddit official apps: 45-50%

What seems to be happening from the numbers as far as I can tell is that when the biggest matches are on, the percentage of traffic from 'old reddit' (the original reddit web version) drops a fair bit compared to where it normally sits, and the percentage of traffic from mobile web/apps increases. So when there's a big match on, a lot of people move to their phones or tablets.

91,World Cup 2019 England vs Afghanistan: it’s time for England to check their bench strength," 

World cup hosts England is taking on Afghanistan at Old Trafford, Manchester today. It is expected to be the high scoring encounter as the last match India vs Pakistan produced a high scoring octane on last Sunday. For England, they are on a roller coaster ride as they remain unbeaten so far. Not only unbeaten most of the matches ended as a one-sided contest on England favour. With home advantage and form of the players will definitely help them and it will be an easy task for them to seal a victory.  They are facing few injury worries like Jason Roy left the field in the last match against Bangladesh and he will be out for two matches. Eoin Morgan is also facing injury niggles and he is expected to be fit for today’s match.

Afghanistan on another hand yet to play a 50 over innings in batting as they are suffering the batting collapse in every match. Once their top order got out their batting line-up getting collapsed every time. This is the never-ending story. It’s high time that their batting order should step up and do the needful for the team’s cause. Rashid Khan has been less effective these days and it seems to be the worrying factor for them. He is not getting wickets as he has done in the past and he looks like an out of touch these days. So Afghanistan is having plenty of problems to fix but if their spin bowlers play up to their potential they can be match winners.

93,Clive Rice and His Disillusionment,"In the recent 80s all rounders thread there were a few sentiments along the lines of ""gee, I'd never heard of this bloke - seems like he was really good'' which is a rather common story.

It's widely accepted he'd have been an absolute star test cricketer and that (due to Apartheid etc) his career almost tragically flew under the radar of many, if not most modern cricket fans. (I don't think many would disagree there?)

/u/mundanemister posted [an interesting link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/southafrica/11767520/Clive-Rice-obituary-Best-cricketer-who-never-played-a-Test.html) where a line towards the end got me thinking.

*He was plagued by cancer, a brain tumour and other illnesses in his last years,* ***and perhaps by more bitterness than most cricketers.***

Now THIS is something I've always felt but never really heard or read anything on. In any picture, interview or commentary stint in which he was involved that I can recall, he was always quite a terse, gruff, intimidating type of character. The article sort of touches on this as well.

If he were to have been bitter about his cricketing situation it is perfectly understandable imo, I'm definitely not having a go at him.

But I'm curious, did he ever talk much about this? Was there much written? It was always something of a tough topic to speak about publicly so I suspect most of his bitterness was kept internal and unexpressed.",Cricket,1560839766,showmanic,8,12,True,2019-06-18

111,What do you think are the Windies' problems?,"I think it's that they're all the same. Their batting, besides Shai Hope, is 'whack it as hard as we can', down to Jason Holder (or, in last night's case, Darren Bravo). Most of their wickets vs Bangladesh were failed big shots, besides Gayle and Dre Russ.

&amp;#x200B;

Again with the bowling; they consistently pull it up and they're all tall pacers, only spinner is Chris Gayle; come on, you can do better, IMO Nurse should have been replaced for Narine. It's a mess really, and the bowlers aren't really that good either, look at Shannon Gabriel, that was poor. Oshane and Cottrell have been slightly expensive as well, though Cottrell has been class in the field.

148,[MUST READ] Why a 20-Team format is the most ideal for a 50-over CWC.,"Firstly, we'll address the elephant in the room. The 2019 and 2023 World Cups have come under criticism and often been identified as 'glorified Champions trophies' for the shortened number of teams. Sure, ""revenue blah blah"" maybe the excuse given by ICC, but it cuts off the globalization of the second most viewed sport in the world. A lot of cricketing legends have pretty much slammed the shortened quota, including the God of Cricket himself. Cricket would be really boring without associate nations, and we would not have seen some glorious upsets (props to Ireland's cricket team for most of them) or the rise of associate nations like Bangladesh and especially Afghanistan. There are so many cricket crazy nations, especially in Asia itself (UAE, Oman, Nepal, PNG .etc.) who are not getting the recognition they are due.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this will be a lengthy wall of text that becomes a bit mathematical. For simplicity purposes, I'll keep the tournaments restricted to only single group stages as well as the knockout rounds, as I believe that multiple group stages (see 2012 T20 World Cup and the Super Eight phase) won't work well with a 50 over cup (see more when you reach ""14 teams""). As for the lettering below, **10G + 7K** would mean **10 group stage matches** and **7 knockout rounds (4 QF + 2 SF + 1F)**. If you see group stages being labelled as 6 x 4 or 5 x 2, **the former is the number of teams per group, the latter is the number of groups**.

&amp;#x200B;

With that out of the way, let's get on with the topic. I believe that a 50 over World Cup works best length-wise ***if the matches are between 40 to 55*** as anything more will make the CWC far too lengthy and disrupt touring schedules of the teams, anything less makes the CWC not as exciting. So for the number of teams, I'll start with 10, 11, 12, 14 and make my way to 40, making sure the numbers above 14 are divisible by 8, if not then 4. ***I'll make sure to avoid any number that results in multiple group stages (although if they're listed below and automatically break the quota then they'll be striked through).*** ***The qualifications of group stages should lead directly into the knockout rounds (aka 8 or 4 teams qualifying from group stages without any odd numbering)***. For group stages, only the round robin version is acceptable. Keep the above bold points in mind. I'll be saving the highlight of the topic (20 teams) for last.

&amp;#x200B;

* **~~10 teams~~** **-** Two versions are possible, either a full round robin (1992 though it had 9 teams instead, 2019, 2023) or 5 x 2 groups. The first case results in 45G + 3K and in the latter case it comes down to 20G + 3K. In either case, the *number of teams are far too low, in the latter case the number of matches are too low*.
* **~~11 teams~~** **-** Again, *less number of teams. Round robin is not possible due to number of matches exceeding limit (55G + 3K)*, grouping is not possible either.
* **~~12 teams~~** **-** *Less teams* (again, \*sigh\*), *round robin results in 66G + 3K*. Grouping in 6 x 2 results in 30G + 7K, which is similar to the 1996 and 1999 CWCs though *has less number of matches*.
* **14 teams -** The second most ideal format, used in the 2003, 2011 and 2015 editions (though the 2003 edition had a super six group stage as well, which I didn't really find appealing and the fact that they only played 3 teams each in that stage). Ideal grouping is 7 x 2 which results in 42G + 7K and is a decent length which allows quite a number of associates to play in the international spotlight. This had become the default tournament format until recently.
* **~~16 teams~~** **-** The 2007 World Cup, latter case written below. Although 16 teams sounds more appealing than 14, the formats don't. Either 8 x 2 *(which increases tournament length)* or 4 x 4. The 4 x 4 versions results in 24G + 7K. *Quota broken due to less number of matches*.
* **~~24 teams~~** **-** Either 6 x 4 or 8 x 3. *The latter is not going to be possible due to improper knockout qualification quota*. 6 x 4 results in 60G + 3K or 7K, *either of which is too lengthy*.
* **~~28 teams~~** **-** Formats possible are 7 x 4, *which results in way too many matches*, almost twice that of 14 teams, or 4 x 7 *which breaks the qualification quota*.
* **32 teams -** First, 8 x 4 *results in too lengthy a tournament*. 4 x 8 results in 48G + 7K, which is at the maximum quota. This format could work in the future, when the sport is more global but for the time being it'll be counted as going too far. It also means that only the top team in each group can qualify. Third most ideal format.
* **~~36 teams~~** **-**  *9 x 4 is too lengthy. 4 x 9 is not viable.*
* **~~40 teams~~** **-**  *10 x 4 and 5 x 8 are too lengthy. 4 x 10 and 8 x 5 are not viable.*
* **20 teams -** And finally, we get to the best possible format. Having 5 teams in 4 groups each, with top 2 qualifying for knockouts will result in 10 matches per group, which results in 40G + 7K. This pretty much puts the number of matches in a comfortable medium position within the above listed quota (one less than 2019 format, two less than 14 team format one). A lot of associate nations also get to play in an international spotlight. The way to balance out test and associate nations would be to group the top 10 among themselves, and the associate in the remaining two groups. This format doesn't push too many teams into the CWC and make it feel cramped, and each team plays a healthy amount of matches (4 + 3 possible knockouts) compared to the 32 team format (3 + 3 possible knockouts). We get to see a decent amount of different colored jerseys mingling with each other.

Same with Ashwin's ethical sledging, I can't stop laughing at his 'ethics above all' approach and his Twitter battles. I wish he'd continue more often.

Just like Koach's RTG. Look at the world right now - it's so mundane. 2018 was amazing because of all the ""bhenchod RTG strikes again"" memes and speculation about how peak RTG could have Rahul as a full-time keeper, Rohit opening, and things like that.

260,"If you could choose one player from another country in the World Cup to improve your team, who would it be?","A more challenging decision than it seems. For example, as an England fan, would picking the best batsman in the world (Kohli) really make the most difference to England, as we already have Root in this role? Likewise, Rohit instead of Vince would make a massive impact if Roy is injured, but Rohit over Roy less so.

&amp;#x200B;

Shakib is definitely a candidate, but who do you drop for him? If you drop Moeen or Rashid, isn't Shakib (or Stokes, or whoever) wasted batting at 7? 

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, for England, I reckon either Starc or Bumrah would make the biggest impact - probably Starc due to the left arm variety that is currently lacking.

272,"There's a short ball fetish in this World Cup, and it's failing","Due to the wickets having true carry and bounce and sometimes due to the wickets being flat, bowlers have liked to use the short ball a bit too much actually. But with the exception of the Pakistan vs West Indies match, it's actually been counter productive for the bowling team, like England, West Indies and South Africa have found out.

I guess teams need to get their heads out of their asses and evolve, rather than being one trick ponies. Even today, England overdid the short ball, but didn't pay the price due to their mammoth score. But West Indies and South Africa have been pretty much knocked out, and this ploy has a lot to do with it, but sadly both Holder and Ngidi aren't acknowledging that they need to try something else, which is both weird and worrisome.

Teams in a World Cup follow the Darwinian model, if you don't evolve according to the circumstances, you get knocked out, and this ploy can knock the stuffing out of some of the big names come when kingdom come.",Cricket,1560881064,a-Sociopath,21,24,True,2019-06-18

286,To my fellow Pakistanis,"This is the best XI in our country barring maybe Fawad Alam. A change in captain, a change in coaching or a change in a few players will not improve this team much. The truth is since the CT Final we have a record of 16-24 and if we remove that Zimbabwe series it’s 11-24. The CT Win itself had a fair bit of luck in it, in such a short tournament a bit of luck and a couple individual performances can win you the competition. 

I’d like to tell my fellow Pakistanis the future for our cricket does not look bright. The big 3 are far ahead, NZ and SA (even though they’ve been poor this WC) are ahead even Bangladesh seems to have pulled it level to us except they are trending upwards and we are trending downwards. 

We need to stop expecting too much from our team for at least a decade. Even if we completely uproot the cricketing structure in this country and start to do it today it’ll take at least 10 years to finally see some positive results. 

This isn’t the result of a couple shitty selections, or a couple crappy players it’s the result of decades of mismanagement, corruption and incompetence; kinda domes up Pakistan as a whole. 

This isn’t a shit post; this is accepting reality because I know we can be better and we will be better. Pakistan Zindabad!

Granted, most of the time the batting team wouldn’t gain much by doing it, but on the other hand, it makes no difference if they lose a wicket off the last ball and in tight games it could force the fielding team into mistakes and earn them an extra run/overthrows.

I know the ICC ODI world cup is going on and its been pretty good except for the washouts but its just not test cricket.  I tried catching up on a few first class matches but they don't have the same zing to it. It just isn't test cricket. My friends have suggested watching paint dry as an alternative but  after watching the wall for 2 hours and taking a break for lunch, I notice that the paint has  already dried when I come back and its game over. Even the bloody 20Ts last longer than that. Its a disgrace, the shortest form of the game but they still last longer than a football match.

This time I forgot to not follow test cricket scores for test matches that were taking place parallely a few months leading to the blackout period.

South Africa will realize the fact that they need to win all matches in order to seal semi-final berth but they have to face an uphill task against mighty New Zealand side who are unbeaten as of now. Batting worries coupled with lack of contribution at crucial stages from the bowlers contributed for their losses. They have back on winning ways as they defeated minnows Bangladesh at their last encounter. South Africa will be keen to continue the momentum. It’s time for Amla to step up and produce a good score that will help them to post a competitive total. On their bowling part lungi, Nigidi has completely recovered from his illness and he is expected in place for Raza Hendricks.

380,World cup scheduling fuckery,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is a huge possibility of the scheduling leading to unfairness.

Because this is a long round-robin stage, it is possible that a team qualifies super early and has a lot of dead rubbers for their later games. Now, a team in this position would most likely be one of the best teams (since they were the first ones to qualify). And since they have qualified, it is highly likely that they will rest a significan chunk of their squad, especially fast bowlers, to reduce injury risk. And they'll also obviously stop playing as intensely.

This becomes very unfair for a team struggling to qualify if they had to play the strong team in the first half when they were bulldozing and have their competitor play the strong team in the second half when they don't give a fuck.

Case in point: It is very likely that NZ vs Eng will not matter for Eng. It is also very likely that there will be a qualification fight between Bangladesh and NZ. Eng vs NZ is the last game for Eng and if Eng rests most of their players and NZ wins, Bangladesh will be hard done by.

Another thing that the format will lead to is that it is actually benificial for the strong team to lose dead rubbers against weak teams thus having weaker teams qualify for knockouts. It is unlikely they'll do this because honour and ethics and all that but the fact that this is possible is a huge concern.",Cricket,1560935333,feuhrer,19,1,True,2019-06-19

442,My WC format and qualification pathway,"For the main WC, I would have 3 groups of 5 teams each. IMO 4 group matches is the right balance between giving enough matches to prevent a washout from having a severe affect, and not making it too long so that each match result is very important. 

Group topper goes straight to the super 6, but A2 vs B3, B2 vs C3 and C2 vs A3 crossover playoffs for the remaining three spots. This reduces dead rubbers since even if you win first three games, you want to win the last game inorder to ensure the top spot, and even if you have lost first two games, you can scratch into third place from where it's one knockout game deciding your future.

In Super 6, everyone plays each other once (no carry forward points since there can be different number of teams from different groups). This, followed by IPL style playoffs. Why playoffs instead of direct final? Again, to reduce dead rubbers. If we only have a final, teams will be knocked out early, but if we have playoffs, they can get into 4th spot from where it's 3 knockouts to the cup. Also, playoffs are superior to Semis in every way.

**Total games : 30 (GS) + 3 (Crossover) + 15 (Super 6) + 4 (Playoffs) = 52 which is right about the last 3 WC length.**

Now, for the qualification, I have gone with regional based qualification.

[Image here](https://i.imgur.com/NgziaX7.png)

Each region gets a certain number of direct qualification spots, and certain number of Global Qualifier spots. Total 12 teams qualify directly, and the next 12 teams play in the Global Qualifiers for the remaining 12 spots.

No team gets a direct WC qualification, but top 19 ranked teams get directly into Regional finals. (IMO while India should play teams like HK and UAE, there is no use of having to play Saudi Arabia or some other). 

For the global qualifiers, I put the 12 teams into 3 groups of 4. After the group stage, we have crossover playoffs for A2 vs B3, B2 vs C3 and C2 vs A3. The winners of these matches play the third group stage toppers for the three WC spots. Or if you prefer, we can directly have A1 vs B2 and so on for the last three spots.",Cricket,1560953199,SreesanthTakesIt,6,7,True,2019-06-19

454,SA's Batsmen in Review,"Our WC is basically over. Guppy, Kane and Taylor are not going to screw this up. My review:  
**Amla** \- Should never have gone. Spot should've gone to Reeza. His Test batting in this WC has confirmed that. - 2/10  
**QdK** \- Not consistent enough. Young and in his first WC, so will give the benefit of the doubt. 4/10  
**Markram** \- What is the point of playing him AND Amla in the same team? Absolutely nothing. If we needed to protect him, he should've batted at 6/7 like QdK did when he started. Unimpressed, but not his fault. Absolute piss poor selection/order placement by CSA - 4/10  
**Faf** \- Being put in so early (given Hash/QdK's failures) never helps. Gets out cheaply. Needed to be a rock for the more explosive vd Dussen. 3/10  
**vd Dussen** \- The light in a very, very dark batting lineup. Most consistent performer, always bats with intent - 6/10  
Miller - Should not bat in the same team as vd Dussen. Done nothing for his ""Killer Miller"" reputation thus far. Needed more Killer. 1/10

**Duminy** \- I'm still trying to work out what exactly he was picked for? He can light up the domestic scene quick enough, but in intl's, seems to focus on his bowling. 2/10

**Andile** \- Picked more for bowling than batting, and it shows. Can't be harsh on him, he tried his usual allround pinch hitting, didn't come off. 4/10  
**Morris** \- expected more finishing and swashbuckling. Delivered what he could, but had no real platform as top order underperformed - 4.5/10  
**Pretorius/Rabada/Immy/Hendricks/Lungi** \- all tailenders, not known for their batting, but had to bat. A few star performers here and there, but honestly shouldn't be called upon. 5/10",Cricket,1560958310,DazzaRPD,5,2,True,2019-06-19

457,Najam sethi reveals the reasons behind Pakistan's world Cup debacle,"* There is an extreme amount of in fighting within the new PCB. This infighting is spilling over onto the on field morale of Pakistan team.

* The new prime minister constituted a new 'cricket Committee' consisting of 1 PCB official and 2 outsider. One of them was the famous and respected ex Pakistan player wasim akram. However, he has a very bad relationship with one of the remaining two committee member (because he had accused akram of being a fixer in the past)

* Najam sethi says that when he was PCB chief, it was decided that sarfaraz and the team  from champions trophy tournament would remain more or less the same for the world cup. This decision was taken to ensure that the players get a boost of confidence and they don't have to constantly worry about being dropped after a bad performance. The new PCB appointed by imran khan however remarked in public that sarfaraz will be ousted as captain if he isn't upto the mark. Similar proclamations were made about the other players too. Najam sethi complains that publicly talking about dropping players undermined their confidence and moral for the world cup


* Talks about firing mickey Arthur and other coaches were making the round too. This caused mickey and other coaches  to get scared that they  are going to lose their job soon. As a result, they started hiring and engaging with lobbyists and agents close to the new prime minister to ensure that they don't get booted. This environment of fear and politics caused a massive degradation of morale within the dressing room. Both players and coaches were uncertain about their future in the team for the world cup 

* both wasim akram and najam sethi complain that Pakistan first class cricket is in tatters. The number of teams were reduced from 16 to 6. The quality is degrading.

476,Guptill Dismissal,"Just a quick question about Guptill's hit wicket today.

For those who haven't seen it, he pulls the ball, spins round and slips as he sets off for a run, hitting the stumps in the process, and is given out hit wicket.

Now a few days ago (think it was in the West Indies v Bangladesh match), a batsman played and missed, swung the bat round (completing a hook/pull) then back again, hitting the wicket. The TV umpire called it not out as 'he's through the shot'. The ball at this stage either hadn't reached the keeper, or had only just been taken (TV ump didn't look at this), so wasn't definitively a dead ball.

Would genuinely like to know why one was given out and the other not. Was it a case of the not out instance being deemed dead? Or just a bad decision?",Cricket,1560968105,chrisb993,12,74,True,2019-06-19

479,My James Vince verdict (international cricket) as a Hampshire fan,"Right, before anything, he is undeniably an unbelievably talented batsman. His struggle for England is never his actual batting, it is his mental attitude. He often rushes into acceleration, feeling under pressure. Teams often bounce him out after about 25 balls, as his pull shot is low to high. His cover drive is nearly on par with Root if not level, and his technique on his day is simply stunning. Watching on for Hampshire he takes teams apart, but what is the issue in international cricket?

1. The nick to the slips (test cricket)
Everyone knows this about James Vince. He has a delightful cover drive, one that makes you sigh and applaud. So why does he get out to it. Simply put, he does it too often. If he reigns it in, he would be so much more effective. He is at his best when he is punching it vertical bat, not wafting horizontal bat. This is because any hint of swing, takes it off his outside edge. That, is 100% a mental issue and not a technical one.

2. The pull shot (one day)
As Michael Vaughan said on TMS commentary against Afghanistan on Tuesday, “there is a massive fault in his pull shot, in which it goes low to high not in control, and not high to low and rolling his wrists on it so it is under control”. I have to agree, as he never tries to hit it for 6, so it is just a nothing shot. He neither goes over the top nor keeps it down. It looks great when it comes off, but too many times it will pop off the top edge to fine leg or drop off the under edge. This is not a mental one, but a technical one and one I’m surprised England haven’t picked up on and worked on

3. What on Earth goes through his mind when he gets to 30
Simply put, I do not know. He seems to think that for international cricket, he needs to score 400 every time, and therefore doesn’t build his innings, just attacking. I have a feeling opening the batting does no favours for him whatsoever, there is some mental block when he opens, batting three or four for Hampshire is when he’s at his best, but then again, to be at the top level, you need to be able to adapt (eg Root v Windies).

In conclusion, he HAS to make 100 against Sri Lanka imo, 70 is not enough, because once again a ‘start’ doesn’t cut it at international level. He has all the tools, but needs to focus and apply himself a bit more",Cricket,1560968526,Superonkey101,12,14,True,2019-06-19
